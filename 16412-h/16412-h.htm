<h1>A STUDY OF SHAKESPEARE<br />
BY ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE.</h1>
<h2>PREFACE TO THIS EDITION</h2>
<p>Begun in the winter of 1874, a first instalment of &ldquo;A Study
of Shakespeare&rdquo; appeared in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> for
May 1875, and a second in the number for June 1876, but the completed
work was not issued in book form until June 1880.&nbsp; In a letter
to me (January 31, 1875), Swinburne said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am now at work on my long-designed essay or
study on the metrical progress or development of Shakespeare, as traceable
by ear and <i>not</i> by finger, and the general changes of tone and
stages of mind expressed or involved in this change or progress of style.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book was produced at the moment when controversy with regard
to the internal evidence of composition in the writings attributed to
Shakespeare was raging high, and the amusing appendices were added at
the last moment that they might infuriate the pedants of the New Shakespeare
Society.&nbsp; They amply fulfilled that amiable purpose.</p>

<h2>A STUDY OF SHAKESPEARE.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>The greatest poet of our age has drawn a parallel of elaborate eloquence
between Shakespeare and the sea; and the likeness holds good in many
points of less significance than those which have been set down by the
master-hand.&nbsp; For two hundred years at least have students of every
kind put forth in every sort of boat on a longer or a shorter voyage
of research across the waters of that unsounded sea.&nbsp; From the
paltriest fishing-craft to such majestic galleys as were steered by
Coleridge and by Goethe, each division of the fleet has done or has
essayed its turn of work; some busied in dredging alongshore, some taking
surveys of this or that gulf or headland, some putting forth through
shine and shadow into the darkness of the great deep.&nbsp; Nor does
it seem as if there would sooner be an end to men&rsquo;s labour on
this than on the other sea.&nbsp; But here a difference is perceptible.&nbsp;
The material ocean has been so far mastered by the wisdom and the heroism
of man that we may look for a time to come when the mystery shall be
manifest of its furthest north and south, and men resolve the secret
of the uttermost parts of the sea: the poles also may find their Columbus.&nbsp;
But the limits of that other ocean, the laws of its tides, the motive
of its forces, the mystery of its unity and the secret of its change,
no seafarer of us all may ever think thoroughly to know.&nbsp; No wind-gauge
will help us to the science of its storms, no lead-line sound for us
the depth of its divine and terrible serenity.</p>
<p>As, however, each generation for some two centuries now or more has
witnessed fresh attempts at pilotage and fresh expeditions of discovery
undertaken in the seas of Shakespeare, it may be well to study a little
the laws of navigation in such waters as these, and look well to compass
and rudder before we accept the guidance of a strange helmsman or make
proffer for trial of our own.&nbsp; There are shoals and quicksands
on which many a seafarer has run his craft aground in time past, and
others of more special peril to adventurers of the present day.&nbsp;
The chances of shipwreck vary in a certain degree with each new change
of vessel and each fresh muster of hands.&nbsp; At one time a main rock
of offence on which the stoutest ships of discovery were wont to split
was the narrow and slippery reef of verbal emendation; and upon this
our native pilots were too many of them prone to steer.&nbsp; Others
fell becalmed offshore in a German fog of philosophic theories, and
would not be persuaded that the house of words they had built in honour
of Shakespeare was &ldquo;dark as hell,&rdquo; seeing &ldquo;it had
bay-windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clear-stories towards
the south-north were as lustrous as ebony.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are not
the most besetting dangers of more modern steersmen: what we have to
guard against now is neither a repetition of the pedantries of Steevens
nor a recrudescence of the moralities of Ulrici.&nbsp; Fresh follies
spring up in new paths of criticism, and fresh labourers in a fruitless
field are at hand to gather them and to garner.&nbsp; A discovery of
some importance has recently been proclaimed as with blare of vociferous
trumpets and flutter of triumphal flags; no less a discovery than this&mdash;that
a singer must be tested by his song.&nbsp; Well, it is something that
criticism should at length be awake to that wholly indisputable fact;
that learned and laborious men who can hear only with their fingers
should open their eyes to admit such a novelty, their minds to accept
such a paradox, as that a painter should be studied in his pictures
and a poet in his verse.&nbsp; To the common herd of students and lovers
of either art this may perhaps appear no great discovery; but that it
should at length have dawned even upon the race of commentators is a
sign which in itself might be taken as a presage of new light to come
in an epoch of miracle yet to be.&nbsp; Unhappily it is as yet but a
partial revelation that has been vouchsafed to them.&nbsp; To the recognition
of the apocalyptic fact that a workman can only be known by his work,
and that without examination of his method and material that work can
hardly be studied to much purpose, they have yet to add the knowledge
of a further truth no less recondite and abstruse than this; that as
the technical work of a painter appeals to the eye, so the technical
work of a poet appeals to the ear.&nbsp; It follows that men who have
none are as likely to arrive at any profitable end by the application
of metrical tests to the work of Shakespeare as a blind man by the application
of his theory of colours to the work of Titian.</p>
<p>It is certainly no news to other than professional critics that no
means of study can be more precious or more necessary to a student of
Shakespeare than this of tracing the course of his work by the growth
and development, through various modes and changes, of his metre.&nbsp;
But the faculty of using such means of study is not to be had for the
asking; it is not to be earned by the most assiduous toil, it is not
to be secured by the learning of years, it is not to be attained by
the devotion of a life.&nbsp; No proficiency in grammar and arithmetic,
no science of numeration and no scheme of prosody, will be here of the
least avail.&nbsp; Though the pedagogue were Briareus himself who would
thus bring Shakespeare under the rule of his rod or Shelley within the
limit of his line, he would lack fingers on which to count the syllables
that make up their music, the infinite varieties of measure that complete
the changes and the chimes of perfect verse.&nbsp; It is but lost labour
that they rise up so early, and so late take rest; not a Scaliger or
Salmasius of them all will sooner solve the riddle of the simplest than
of the subtlest melody.&nbsp; Least of all will the method of a scholiast
be likely to serve him as a clue to the hidden things of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
For all the counting up of numbers and casting up of figures that a
whole university&mdash;nay, a whole universe of pedants could accomplish,
no teacher and no learner will ever be a whit the nearer to the haven
where they would be.&nbsp; In spite of all tabulated statements and
regulated summaries of research, the music which will not be dissected
or defined, the &ldquo;spirit of sense&rdquo; which is one and indivisible
from the body or the raiment of speech that clothes it, keeps safe the
secret of its sound.&nbsp; Yet it is no less a task than this that the
scholiasts have girt themselves to achieve: they will pluck out the
heart not of Hamlet&rsquo;s but of Shakespeare&rsquo;s mystery by the
means of a metrical test; and this test is to be applied by a purely
arithmetical process.&nbsp; It is useless to pretend or to protest that
they work by any rule but the rule of thumb and finger: that they have
no ear to work by, whatever outward show they may make of unmistakable
ears, the very nature of their project gives full and damning proof.&nbsp;
Properly understood, this that they call the metrical test is doubtless,
as they say, the surest or the sole sure key to one side of the secret
of Shakespeare; but they will never understand it properly who propose
to secure it by the ingenious device of numbering the syllables and
tabulating the results of a computation which shall attest in exact
sequence the quantity, order, and proportion of single and double endings,
of rhyme and blank verse, of regular lines and irregular, to be traced
in each play by the horny eye and the callous finger of a pedant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am ill at these numbers&rdquo;; those in which I have sought
to become an expert are numbers of another sort; but having, from wellnigh
the first years I can remember, made of the study of Shakespeare the
chief intellectual business and found in it the chief spiritual delight
of my whole life, I can hardly think myself less qualified than another
to offer an opinion on the metrical points at issue.</p>
<p>The progress and expansion of style and harmony in the successive
works of Shakespeare must in some indefinite degree be perceptible to
the youngest as to the oldest, to the dullest as to the keenest of Shakespearean
students.&nbsp; But to trace and verify the various shades and gradations
of this progress, the ebb and flow of alternate influences, the delicate
and infinite subtleties of change and growth discernible in the spirit
and the speech of the greatest among poets, is a task not less beyond
the reach of a scholiast than beyond the faculties of a child.&nbsp;
He who would attempt it with any chance of profit must above all things
remember at starting that the inner and the outer qualities of a poet&rsquo;s
work are of their very nature indivisible; that any criticism is of
necessity worthless which looks to one side only, whether it be to the
outer or to the inner quality of the work; that the fatuity of pedantic
ignorance never devised a grosser absurdity than the attempt to separate
&aelig;sthetic from scientific criticism by a strict line of demarcation,
and to bring all critical work under one or the other head of this exhaustive
division.&nbsp; Criticism without accurate science of the thing criticised
can indeed have no other value than may belong to the genuine record
of a spontaneous impression; but it is not less certain that criticism
which busies itself only with the outer husk or technical shell of a
great artist&rsquo;s work, taking no account of the spirit or the thought
which informs it, cannot have even so much value as this.&nbsp; Without
study of his forms of metre or his scheme of colours we shall certainly
fail to appreciate or even to apprehend the gist or the worth of a painter&rsquo;s
or a poet&rsquo;s design; but to note down the number of special words
and cast up the sum of superfluous syllables used once or twice or twenty
times in the structure of a single poem will help us exactly as much
as a naked catalogue of the colours employed in a particular picture.&nbsp;
A tabulated statement or summary of the precise number of blue or green,
red or white draperies to be found in a precise number of paintings
by the same hand will not of itself afford much enlightenment to any
but the youngest of possible students; nor will a mere list of double
or single, masculine or feminine terminations discoverable in a given
amount of verse from the same quarter prove of much use or benefit to
an adult reader of common intelligence.&nbsp; What such an one requires
is the guidance which can be given by no metremonger or colour-grinder:
the suggestion which may help him to discern at once the cause and the
effect of every choice or change of metre and of colour; which may show
him at one glance the reason and the result of every shade and of every
tone which tends to compose and to complete the gradual scale of their
final harmonies.&nbsp; This method of study is generally accepted as
the only one applicable to the work of a great painter by any criticism
worthy of the name: it should also be recognised as the sole method
by which the work of a great poet can be studied to any serious purpose.&nbsp;
For the student it can be no less useful, for the expert it should be
no less easy, to trace through its several stages of expansion and transfiguration
the genius of Chaucer or of Shakespeare, of Milton or of Shelley, than
the genius of Titian or of Raffaelle, of Turner or of Rossetti.&nbsp;
Some great artists there are of either kind in whom no such process
of growth or transformation is perceptible: of these are Coleridge and
Blake; from the sunrise to the sunset of their working day we can trace
no demonstrable increase and no visible diminution of the divine capacities
or the inborn defects of either man&rsquo;s genius; but not of such,
as a rule, are the greatest among artists of any sort.</p>
<p>Another rock on which modern steersmen of a more skilful hand than
these are yet liable to run through too much confidence is the love
of their own conjectures as to the actual date or the secret history
of a particular play or passage.&nbsp; To err on this side requires
more thought, more learning, and more ingenuity than we need think to
find in a whole tribe of finger-counters and figure-casters; but the
outcome of these good gifts, if strained or perverted to capricious
use, may prove no less barren of profit than the labours of a pedant
on the letter of the text.&nbsp; It is a tempting exercise of intelligence
for a dexterous and keen-witted scholar to apply his solid learning
and his vivid fancy to the detection or the interpretation of some new
or obscure point in a great man&rsquo;s life or work; but none the less
is it a perilous pastime to give the reins to a learned fancy, and let
loose conjecture on the trail of any dubious crotchet or the scent of
any supposed allusion that may spring up in the way of its confident
and eager quest.&nbsp; To start a new solution of some crucial problem,
to track some new undercurrent of concealed significance in a passage
hitherto neglected or misconstrued, is to a critic of this higher class
a delight as keen as that of scientific discovery to students of another
sort: the pity is that he can bring no such certain or immediate test
to verify the value of his discovery as lies ready to the hand of the
man of science.&nbsp; Whether he have lit upon a windfall or a mare&rsquo;s
nest can be decided by no direct proof, but only by time and the general
acceptance of competent judges; and this cannot often be reasonably
expected for theories which can appeal for support or confirmation to
no positive evidence, but at best to a cloudy and shifting probability.&nbsp;
What personal or political allusions may lurk under the text of Shakespeare
we can never know, and should consequently forbear to hang upon a hypothesis
of this floating and nebulous kind any serious opinion which might gravely
affect our estimate of his work or his position in regard to other men,
with whom some public or private interest may possibly have brought
him into contact or collision.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The aim of the present study is simply to set down what the writer
believes to be certain demonstrable truths as to the progress and development
of style, the outer and the inner changes of manner as of matter, of
method as of design, which may be discerned in the work of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
The principle here adopted and the views here put forward have not been
suddenly discovered or lightly taken up out of any desire to make a
show of theoretical ingenuity.&nbsp; For years past I have held and
maintained, in private discussion with friends and fellow-students,
the opinions which I now submit to more public judgment.&nbsp; How far
they may coincide with those advanced by others I cannot say, and have
not been careful to inquire.&nbsp; The mere fact of coincidence or of
dissent on such a question is of less importance than the principle
accepted by either student as the groundwork of his theory, the mainstay
of his opinion.&nbsp; It is no part of my project or my hope to establish
the actual date of any among the various plays, or to determine point
by point the lineal order of their succession.&nbsp; I have examined
no table or catalogue of recent or of earlier date, from the time of
Malone onwards, with a view to confute by my reasoning the conclusions
of another, or by the assistance of his theories to corroborate my own.&nbsp;
It is impossible to fix or decide by inner or outer evidence the precise
order of production, much less of composition, which critics of the
present or the past may have set their wits to verify in vain; but it
is quite possible to show that the work of Shakespeare is naturally
divisible into classes which may serve us to distinguish and determine
as by landmarks the several stages or periods of his mind and art.</p>
<p>Of these the three chief periods or stages are so unmistakably indicated
by the mere text itself, and so easily recognisable by the veriest tiro
in the school of Shakespeare, that even were I as certain of being the
first to point them out as I am conscious of having long since discovered
and verified them without assistance or suggestion from any but Shakespeare
himself, I should be disposed to claim but little credit for a discovery
which must in all likelihood have been forestalled by the common insight
of some hundred or more students in time past.&nbsp; The difficulty
begins with the really debatable question of subdivisions.&nbsp; There
are certain plays which may be said to hang on the borderland between
one period and the next, with one foot lingering and one advanced; and
these must be classed according to the dominant note of their style,
the greater or lesser proportion of qualities proper to the earlier
or the later stage of thought and writing.&nbsp; At one time I was inclined
to think the whole catalogue more accurately divisible into four classes;
but the line of demarcation between the third and fourth would have
been so much fainter than those which mark off the first period from
the second, and the second from the third, that it seemed on the whole
a more correct and adequate arrangement to assume that the last period
might be subdivided if necessary into a first and second stage.&nbsp;
This somewhat precise and pedantic scheme of study I have adopted from
no love of rigid or formal system, but simply to make the method of
my critical process as clear as the design.&nbsp; That design is to
examine by internal evidence alone the growth and the expression of
spirit and of speech, the ebb and flow of thought and style, discernible
in the successive periods of Shakespeare&rsquo;s work; to study the
phases of mind, the changes of tone, the passage or progress from an
old manner to a new, the reversion or relapse from a later to an earlier
habit, which may assuredly be traced in the modulations of his varying
verse, but can only be traced by ear and not by finger.&nbsp; I have
busied myself with no baseless speculations as to the possible or probable
date of the first appearance of this play or of that on the stage; and
it is not unlikely that the order of succession here adopted or suggested
may not always coincide with the chronological order of production;
nor will the principle or theory by which I have undertaken to class
the successive plays of each period be affected or impaired though it
should chance that a play ranked by me as belonging to a later stage
of work should actually have been produced earlier than others which
in my lists are assigned to a subsequent date.&nbsp; It is not, so to
speak, the literal but the spiritual order which I have studied to observe
and to indicate: the periods which I seek to define belong not to chronology
but to art.&nbsp; No student need be reminded how common a thing it
is to recognise in the later work of a great artist some partial reappearance
of his early tone or manner, some passing return to his early lines
of work and to habits of style since modified or abandoned.&nbsp; Such
work, in part at least, may properly be said to belong rather to the
earlier stage whose manner it resumes than to the later stage at which
it was actually produced, and in which it stands out as a marked exception
among the works of the same period.&nbsp; A famous and a most singularly
beautiful example of this reflorescence as in a Saint Martin&rsquo;s
summer of undecaying genius is the exquisite and crowning love-scene
in the opera or &ldquo;ballet-tragedy&rdquo; of <i>Psyche</i>, written
in his sixty-fifth year by the august Roman hand of Pierre Corneille;
a lyric symphony of spirit and of song fulfilled with all the colour
and all the music that autumn could steal from spring if October had
leave to go a Maying in some Olympian masquerade of melody and sunlight.&nbsp;
And it is not easier, easy as it is, to discern and to define the three
main stages of Shakespeare&rsquo;s work and progress, than to classify
under their several heads the representative plays belonging to each
period by the law of their nature, if not by the accident of their date.&nbsp;
There are certain dominant qualities which do on the whole distinguish
not only the later from the earlier plays, but the second period from
the first, the third period from the second; and it is with these qualities
alone that the higher criticism, be it &aelig;sthetic or scientific,
has properly anything to do.</p>
<p>A new method of solution has been applied to various difficulties
which have been discovered or invented in the text by the care or the
perversity of recent commentators, whose principle of explanation is
easier to abuse than to use with any likelihood of profit.&nbsp; It
is at least simple enough for the simplest of critics to apply or misapply:
whenever they see or suspect an inequality or an incongruity which may
be wholly imperceptible to eyes uninured to the use of their spectacles,
they assume at once the presence of another workman, the intrusion of
a stranger&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; This supposition of a double authorship
is naturally as impossible to refute as to establish by other than internal
evidence and appeal to the private judgment or perception of the reader.&nbsp;
But it is no better than the last resource of an empiric, the last refuge
of a sciolist; a refuge which the soundest of scholars will be slowest
to seek, a resource which the most competent of critics will be least
ready to adopt.&nbsp; Once admitted as a principle of general application,
there are no lengths to which it may not carry, there are none to which
it has not carried, the audacious fatuity and the arrogant incompetence
of tamperers with the authentic text.&nbsp; Recent editors who have
taken on themselves the high office of guiding English youth in its
first study of Shakespeare have proposed to excise or to obelise whole
passages which the delight and wonder of youth and age alike, of the
rawest as of the ripest among students, have agreed to consecrate as
examples of his genius at its highest.&nbsp; In the last trumpet-notes
of Macbeth&rsquo;s defiance and despair, in the last rallying cry of
the hero reawakened in the tyrant at his utmost hour of need, there
have been men and scholars, Englishmen and editors, who have detected
the alien voice of a pretender, the false ring of a foreign blast that
was not blown by Shakespeare; words that for centuries past have touched
with fire the hearts of thousands in each age since they were first
inspired&mdash;words with the whole sound in them of battle or a breaking
sea, with the whole soul of pity and terror mingled and melted into
each other in the fierce last speech of a spirit grown &ldquo;aweary
of the sun,&rdquo; have been calmly transferred from the account of
Shakespeare to the score of Middleton.&nbsp; And this, forsooth, the
student of the future is to accept on the authority of men who bring
to the support of their decision the unanswerable plea of years spent
in the collation and examination of texts never hitherto explored and
compared with such energy of learned labour.&nbsp; If this be the issue
of learning and of industry, the most indolent and ignorant of readers
who retains his natural capacity to be moved and mastered by the natural
delight of contact with heavenly things is better off by far than the
most studious and strenuous of all scholiasts who ever claimed acquiescence
or challenged dissent on the strength of his lifelong labours and hard-earned
knowledge of the letter of the text.&nbsp; Such an one is indeed &ldquo;in
a parlous state&rdquo;; and any boy whose heart first begins to burn
within him, who feels his blood kindle and his spirit dilate, his pulse
leap and his eyes lighten, over a first study of Shakespeare, may say
to such a teacher with better reason than Touchstone said to Corin,
&ldquo;Truly, thou art damned; like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nor could charity itself hope much profit for him from the moving appeal
and the pious prayer which temper that severity of sentence&mdash;&ldquo;Wilt
thou rest damned?&nbsp; God help thee, shallow man!&nbsp; God make incision
in thee!&nbsp; Thou art raw.&rdquo;&nbsp; And raw he is like to remain
for all his learning, and for all incisions that can be made in the
horny hide of a self-conceit to be pierced by the puncture of no man&rsquo;s
pen.&nbsp; It was bad enough while theorists of this breed confined
themselves to the suggestion of a possible partnership with Fletcher,
a possible interpolation by Jonson; but in the descent from these to
the alleged adulteration of the text by Middleton and Rowley we have
surely sounded the very lowest depth of folly attainable by the utmost
alacrity in sinking which may yet be possible to the bastard brood of
Scriblerus.&nbsp; For my part, I shall not be surprised though the next
discoverer should assure us that half at least of <i>Hamlet</i> is evidently
due to the collaboration of Heywood, while the greater part of <i>Othello</i>
is as clearly assignable to the hand of Shirley.</p>
<p>Akin to this form of folly, but less pernicious though not more profitable,
is the fancy of inventing some share for Shakespeare in the composition
of plays which the veriest insanity of conjecture or caprice could not
venture to lay wholly to his charge.&nbsp; This fancy, comparatively
harmless as it is, requires no ground of proof to go upon, no prop of
likelihood to support it; without so much help as may be borrowed from
the faintest and most fitful of traditions, it spins its own evidence
spider-like out of its own inner conscience or conceit, and proffers
it with confident complacency for men&rsquo;s acceptance.&nbsp; Here
again I cannot but see a mere waste of fruitless learning and bootless
ingenuity.&nbsp; That Shakespeare began by retouching and recasting
the work of elder and lesser men we all know; that he may afterwards
have set his hand to the task of adding or altering a line or a passage
here and there in some few of the plays brought out under his direction
as manager or proprietor of a theatre is of course possible, but can
neither be affirmed nor denied with any profit in default of the least
fragment of historic or traditional evidence.&nbsp; Any attempt to verify
the imaginary touch of his hand in plays of whose history we know no
more than that they were acted on the boards of his theatre can be but
a diversion for the restless leisure of ingenious and ambitious scholars;
it will give no clue by which the student who simply seeks to know what
can be known with certainty of the poet and his work may hope to be
guided towards any safe issue or trustworthy result.&nbsp; Less pardonable
and more presumptuous than this is the pretension of minor critics to
dissect an authentic play of Shakespeare scene by scene, and assign
different parts of the same poem to different dates by the same pedagogic
rules of numeration and mensuration which they would apply to the general
question of the order and succession of his collective works.&nbsp;
This vivisection of a single poem is not defensible as a freak of scholarship,
an excursion beyond the bounds of bare proof, from which the wanderer
may chance to bring back, if not such treasure as he went out to seek,
yet some stray godsend or rare literary windfall which may serve to
excuse his indulgence in the seemingly profitless pastime of a truant
disposition.&nbsp; It is a pure impertinence to affirm with oracular
assurance what might perhaps be admissible as a suggestion offered with
the due diffidence of modest and genuine scholarship; to assert on the
strength of a private pedant&rsquo;s personal intuition that such must
be the history or such the composition of a great work whose history
he alone could tell, whose composition he alone could explain, who gave
it to us as his genius had given it to him.</p>
<p>From these several rocks and quicksands I trust at least to keep
my humbler course at a safe distance, and steer clear of all sandy shallows
of theory or sunken shoals of hypothesis on which no pilot can be certain
of safe anchorage; avoiding all assumption, though never so plausible,
for which no ground but that of fancy can be shown, all suggestion though
never so ingenious for which no proof but that of conjecture can be
advanced.&nbsp; For instance, I shall neither assume nor accept the
theory of a double authorship or of a double date by which the supposed
inequalities may be accounted for, the supposed difficulties may be
swept away, which for certain readers disturb the study of certain plays
of Shakespeare.&nbsp; Only where universal tradition and the general
concurrence of all reasonable critics past and present combine to indicate
an unmistakable difference of touch or an unmistakable diversity of
date between this and that portion of the same play, or where the internal
evidence of interpolation perceptible to the most careless and undeniable
by the most perverse of readers is supported by the public judgment
of men qualified to express and competent to defend an opinion, have
I thought it allowable to adopt this facile method of explanation.&nbsp;
No scholar, for example, believes in the single authorship of <i>Pericles</i>
or <i>Andronicus</i>; none, I suppose, would now question the part taken
by some hireling or journeyman in the arrangement or completion for
the stage of <i>Timon of Athens</i>; and few probably would refuse to
admit a doubt of the total authenticity or uniform workmanship of the
<i>Taming of the Shrew</i>.&nbsp; As few, I hope, are prepared to follow
the fantastic and confident suggestions of every unquiet and arrogant
innovator who may seek to append his name to the long scroll of Shakespearean
parasites by the display of a brand-new hypothesis as to the uncertain
date or authorship of some passage or some play which has never before
been subjected to the scientific scrutiny of such a pertinacious analyst.&nbsp;
The more modest design of the present study has in part been already
indicated, and will explain as it proceeds if there be anything in it
worth explanation.&nbsp; It is no part of my ambition to loose the Gordian
knots which others who found them indissoluble have sought in vain to
cut in sunder with blunter swords than the Macedonian; but after so
many adventures and attempts there may perhaps yet be room for an attempt
yet unessayed; for a study by the ear alone of Shakespeare&rsquo;s metrical
progress, and a study by light of the knowledge thus obtained of the
corresponsive progress within, which found expression and embodiment
in these outward and visible changes.&nbsp; The one study will be then
seen to be the natural complement and the inevitable consequence of
the other; and the patient pursuit of the simpler and more apprehensible
object of research will appear as the only sure method by which a reasonable
and faithful student may think to attain so much as the porch or entrance
to that higher knowledge which no faithful and reasonable study of Shakespeare
can ever for a moment fail to keep in sight as the haven of its final
hope, the goal of its ultimate labour.</p>
<p>When Christopher Marlowe came up to London from Cambridge, a boy
in years, a man in genius, and a god in ambition, he found the stage
which he was born to transfigure and re-create by the might and masterdom
of his genius encumbered with a litter of rude rhyming farces and tragedies
which the first wave of his imperial hand swept so utterly out of sight
and hearing that hardly by piecing together such fragments of that buried
rubbish as it is now possible to unearth can we rebuild in imagination
so much of the rough and crumbling walls that fell before the trumpet-blast
of <i>Tamburlaine</i> as may give us some conception of the rabble dynasty
of rhymers whom he overthrew&mdash;of the citadel of dramatic barbarism
which was stormed and sacked at the first charge of the young conqueror
who came to lead English audiences and to deliver English poetry</p>
<blockquote><p>From jigging veins of rhyming mother-wits,<br />
And such conceits as clownage keeps in pay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we speak of the drama that existed before the coming of Marlowe,
and that vanished at his advent, we think usually of the rhyming plays
written wholly or mainly in ballad verse of fourteen syllables&mdash;of
the <i>Kings Darius</i> and <i>Cambyses</i>, the <i>Promos and Cassandra</i>
of Whetstone, or the <i>Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes</i> of George Peele.&nbsp;
If we turn from these abortions of tragedy to the metrical farces which
may fairly be said to contain the germ or embryo of English comedy (a
form of dramatic art which certainly owes nothing to the father of our
tragic stage), we find far more of hope and promise in the broad free
stretches of the flagellant head-master of Eton and the bibulous Bishop
of Bath and Wells; and must admit that hands used to wield the crosier
or the birch proved themselves more skilful at the lighter labours of
the stage, more successful even in the secular and bloodless business
of a field neither clerical nor scholastic, than any tragic rival of
the opposite party to that so jovially headed by Orbilius Udall and
Silenus Still.&nbsp; These twin pillars of church and school and stage
were strong enough to support on the shoulders of their authority the
first crude fabric or formless model of our comic theatre, while the
tragic boards were still creaking and cracking under the jingling canter
of <i>Cambyses</i> or the tuneless tramp of <i>Gorboduc</i>.&nbsp; This
one play which the charity of Sidney excepts from his general anathema
on the nascent stage of England has hitherto been erroneously described
as written in blank verse; an error which I can only attribute to the
prevalence of a groundless assumption that whatever is neither prose
nor rhyme must of necessity be definable as blank verse.&nbsp; But the
measure, I must repeat, which was adopted by the authors of <i>Gorboduc</i>
is by no means so definable.&nbsp; Blank it certainly is; but verse
it assuredly is not.&nbsp; There can be no verse where there is no modulation,
no rhythm where there is no music.&nbsp; Blank verse came into life
in England at the birth of the shoemaker&rsquo;s son who had but to
open his yet beardless lips, and the high-born poem which had Sackville
to father and Sidney to sponsor was silenced and eclipsed for ever among
the poor plebeian crowd of rhyming shadows that waited in death on the
noble nothingness of its patrician shade.</p>
<p>These, I suppose, are the first or the only plays whose names recur
to the memory of the general reader when he thinks of the English stage
before Marlowe; but there was, I suspect, a whole class of plays then
current, and more or less supported by popular favour, of which hardly
a sample is now extant, and which cannot be classed with such as these.&nbsp;
The poets or rhymesters who supplied them had already seen good to clip
the cumbrous and bedraggled skirts of those dreary verses, run all to
seed and weed, which jingled their thin bells at the tedious end of
fourteen weary syllables; and for this curtailment of the shambling
and sprawling lines which had hitherto done duty as tragic metre some
credit may be due to these obscure purveyors of forgotten ware for the
second epoch of our stage: if indeed, as I presume, we may suppose that
this reform, such as it was, had begun before the time of Marlowe; otherwise,
no doubt, little credit would be due to men who with so high an example
before them were content simply to snip away the tags and fringes, to
patch the seams and tatters, of the ragged coat of rhyme which they
might have exchanged for that royal robe of heroic verse wherewith he
had clothed the ungrown limbs of limping and lisping tragedy.&nbsp;
But if these also may be reckoned among his precursors, the dismissal
from stage service of the dolorous and drudging metre employed by the
earliest school of theatrical rhymesters must be taken to mark a real
step in advance; and in that case we possess at least a single example
of the rhyming tragedies which had their hour between the last plays
written wholly or partially in ballad metre and the first plays written
in blank verse.&nbsp; The tragedy of <i>Selimus, Emperor of the Turks</i>,
published in 1594, <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30">{30}</a>
may then serve to indicate this brief and obscure period of transition.&nbsp;
Whole scenes of this singular play are written in rhyming iambics, some
in the measure of <i>Don Juan</i>, some in the measure of <i>Venus and
Adonis</i>.&nbsp; The couplets and quatrains so much affected and so
reluctantly abandoned by Shakespeare after the first stage of his dramatic
progress are in no other play that I know of diversified by this alternate
variation of <i>sesta</i> with <i>ottava rima</i>.&nbsp; This may have
been an exceptional experiment due merely to the caprice of one eccentric
rhymester; but in any case we may assume it to mark the extreme limit,
the ultimate development of rhyming tragedy after the ballad metre had
been happily exploded.&nbsp; The play is on other grounds worth attention
as a sign of the times, though on poetical grounds it is assuredly worth
none.&nbsp; Part of it is written in blank verse, or at least in rhymeless
lines; so that after all it probably followed in the wake of <i>Tamburlaine</i>,
half adopting and half rejecting the innovations of that fiery reformer,
who wrought on the old English stage no less a miracle than <i>Hernani</i>
on the French stage in the days of our fathers.&nbsp; That <i>Selimus</i>
was published four years later than <i>Tamburlaine</i>, in the year
following the death of Marlowe, proves of course nothing as to the date
of its production; and even if it was written and acted in the year
of its publication, it undoubtedly in the main represents the work of
a prior era to the reformation of the stage by Marlowe.&nbsp; The level
regularity of its unrhymed scenes is just like that of the weaker portions
of <i>Titus Andronicus</i> and the <i>First Part of King Henry the Sixth</i>&mdash;the
opening scene, for example, of either play.&nbsp; With <i>Andronicus</i>
it has also in common the quality of exceptional monstrosity, a delight
in the parade of mutilation as well as of massacre.&nbsp; It seems to
me possible that the same hand may have been at work on all three plays;
for that Marlowe&rsquo;s is traceable in those parts of the two retouched
by Shakespeare which bear no traces of his touch is a theory to the
full as absurd as that which would impute to Shakespeare the charge
of their entire composition.</p>
<p>The revolution effected by Marlowe naturally raised the same cry
against its author as the revolution effected by Hugo.&nbsp; That Shakespeare
should not at once have enlisted under his banner is less inexplicable
than it may seem.&nbsp; He was naturally addicted to rhyme, though if
we put aside the Sonnets we must admit that in rhyme he never did anything
worth Marlowe&rsquo;s <i>Hero and Leander</i>: he did not, like Marlowe,
see at once that it must be reserved for less active forms of poetry
than the tragic drama; and he was personally, it seems, in opposition
to Marlowe and his school of academic playwrights&mdash;the band of
bards in which Oxford and Cambridge were respectively and so respectably
represented by Peele and Greene.&nbsp; But in his very first plays,
comic or tragic or historic, we can see the collision and conflict of
the two influences; his evil angel, rhyme, yielding step by step and
note by note to the strong advance of that better genius who came to
lead him into the loftier path of Marlowe.&nbsp; There is not a single
passage in <i>Titus Andronicus</i> more Shakespearean than the magnificent
quatrain of Tamora upon the eagle and the little birds; but the rest
of the scene in which we come upon it, and the whole scene preceding,
are in blank verse of more variety and vigour than we find in the baser
parts of the play; and these if any scenes we may surely attribute to
Shakespeare.&nbsp; Again, the last battle of Talbot seems to me as undeniably
the master&rsquo;s work as the scene in the Temple Gardens or the courtship
of Margaret by Suffolk; this latter indeed, full as it is of natural
and vivid grace, may perhaps not be beyond the highest reach of one
or two among the rivals of his earliest years of work; while as we are
certain that he cannot have written the opening scene, that he was at
any stage of his career incapable of it, so may we believe as well as
hope that he is guiltless of any complicity in that detestable part
of the play which attempts to defile the memory of the virgin saviour
of her country. <a name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33">{33}</a>&nbsp;
In style it is not, I think, above the range of George Peele at his
best: and to have written even the last of those scenes can add but
little discredit to the memory of a man already disgraced as the defamer
of Eleanor of Castile; while it would be a relief to feel assured that
there was but one English poet of any genius who could be capable of
either villainy.</p>
<p>In this play, then, more decisively than in <i>Titus Andronicus</i>,
we find Shakespeare at work (so to speak) with both hands&mdash;with
his left hand of rhyme, and his right hand of blank verse.&nbsp; The
left is loth to forego the practice of its peculiar music; yet, as the
action of the right grows freer and its touch grows stronger, it becomes
more and more certain that the other must cease playing, under pain
of producing mere discord and disturbance in the scheme of tragic harmony.&nbsp;
We imagine that the writer must himself have felt the scene of the roses
to be pitched in a truer key than the noble scene of parting between
the old hero and his son on the verge of desperate battle and certain
death.&nbsp; This is the last and loftiest farewell note of rhyming
tragedy; still, in <i>King Richard II</i>, and in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,
it struggles for awhile to keep its footing, but now more visibly in
vain.&nbsp; The rhymed scenes in these plays are too plainly the survivals
of a ruder and feebler stage of work; they cannot hold their own in
the new order with even such discordant effect of incongruous excellence
and inharmonious beauty as belongs to the death-scene of the Talbots
when matched against the quarrelling scene of Somerset and York.&nbsp;
Yet the briefest glance over the plays of the first epoch in the work
of Shakespeare will suffice to show how protracted was the struggle
and how gradual the defeat of rhyme.&nbsp; Setting aside the retouched
plays, we find on the list one tragedy, two histories, and four if not
five comedies, which the least critical reader would attribute to this
first epoch of work.&nbsp; In three of these comedies rhyme can hardly
be said to be beaten; that is, the rhyming scenes are on the whole equal
to the unrhymed in power and beauty.&nbsp; In the single tragedy, and
in one of the two histories, we may say that rhyme fights hard for life,
but is undeniably worsted; that is, they contain as to quantity a large
proportion of rhymed verse, but as to quality the rhymed part bears
no proportion whatever to the unrhymed.&nbsp; In two scenes we may say
that the whole heart or spirit of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> is summed
up and distilled into perfect and pure expression; and these two are
written in blank verse of equable and blameless melody.&nbsp; Outside
the garden scene in the second act and the balcony scene in the third,
there is much that is fanciful and graceful, much of elegiac pathos
and fervid if fantastic passion; much also of superfluous rhetoric and
(as it were) of wordy melody, which flows and foams hither and thither
into something of extravagance and excess; but in these two there is
no flaw, no outbreak, no superflux, and no failure.&nbsp; Throughout
certain scenes of the third and fourth acts I think it may be reasonably
and reverently allowed that the river of verse has broken its banks,
not as yet through the force and weight of its gathering stream, but
merely through the weakness of the barriers or boundaries found insufficient
to confine it.&nbsp; And here we may with deference venture on a guess
why Shakespeare was so long so loth to forego the restraint of rhyme.&nbsp;
When he wrote, and even when he rewrote or at least retouched, his youngest
tragedy he had not yet strength to walk straight in the steps of the
mighty master, but two months older than himself by birth, whose foot
never from the first faltered in the arduous path of severer tragic
verse.&nbsp; The loveliest of love-plays is after all a child of &ldquo;his
salad days, when he was green in judgment,&rdquo; though assuredly not
&ldquo;cold in blood&rdquo;&mdash;a physical condition as difficult
to conceive of Shakespeare at any age as of Cleopatra.&nbsp; It is in
the scenes of vehement passion, of ardour and of agony, that we feel
the comparative weakness of a yet ungrown hand, the tentative uncertain
grasp of a stripling giant.&nbsp; The two utterly beautiful scenes are
not of this kind; they deal with simple joy and with simple sorrow,
with the gladness of meeting and the sadness of parting love; but between
and behind them come scenes of more fierce emotion, full of surprise,
of violence, of unrest; and with these the poet is not yet (if I dare
say so) quite strong enough to deal.&nbsp; Apollo has not yet put on
the sinews of Hercules.&nbsp; At a later date we may fancy or may find
that when the Herculean muscle is full-grown the voice in him which
was as the voice of Apollo is for a passing moment impaired.&nbsp; In
<i>Measure for Measure</i>, where the adult and gigantic god has grappled
with the greatest and most terrible of energies and of passions, we
miss the music of a younger note that rang through <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>;
but before the end this too revives, as pure, as sweet, as fresh, but
richer now and deeper than its first clear notes of the morning, in
the heavenly harmony of <i>Cymbeline</i> and <i>The Tempest</i>.</p>
<p>The same effusion or effervescence of words is perceptible in <i>King
Richard II</i>. as in the greater (and the less good) part of <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i>; and not less perceptible is the perpetual inclination
of the poet to revert for help to rhyme, to hark back in search of support
towards the half-forsaken habits of his poetic nonage.&nbsp; Feeling
his foothold insecure on the hard and high ascent of the steeps of rhymeless
verse, he stops and slips back ever and anon towards the smooth and
marshy meadow whence he has hardly begun to climb.&nbsp; Any student
who should wish to examine the conditions of the struggle at its height
may be content to analyse the first act of this the first historical
play of Shakespeare.&nbsp; As the tragedy moves onward, and the style
gathers strength while the action gathers speed,&mdash;as (to borrow
the phrase so admirably applied by Coleridge to Dryden) the poet&rsquo;s
chariot-wheels get hot by driving fast,&mdash;the temptation of rhyme
grows weaker, and the hand grows firmer which before lacked strength
to wave it off.&nbsp; The one thing wholly or greatly admirable in this
play is the exposition of the somewhat pitiful but not unpitiable character
of King Richard.&nbsp; Among the scenes devoted to this exposition I
of course include the whole of the death-scene of Gaunt, as well the
part which precedes as the part which follows the actual appearance
of his nephew on the stage; and into these scenes the intrusion of rhyme
is rare and brief.&nbsp; They are written almost wholly in pure and
fluent rather than vigorous or various blank verse; though I cannot
discern in any of them an equality in power and passion to the magnificent
scene of abdication in Marlowe&rsquo;s <i>Edward II</i>.&nbsp; This
play, I think, must undoubtedly be regarded as the immediate model of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s; and the comparison is one of inexhaustible interest
to all students of dramatic poetry.&nbsp; To the highest height of the
earlier master I do not think that the mightier poet who was as yet
in great measure his pupil has ever risen in this the first (as I take
it) of his historic plays.&nbsp; Of composition and proportion he has
perhaps already a somewhat better idea.&nbsp; But in grasp of character,
always excepting the one central figure of the piece, we find his hand
as yet the unsteadier of the two.&nbsp; Even after a lifelong study
of this as of all other plays of Shakespeare, it is for me at least
impossible to determine what I doubt if the poet could himself have
clearly defined&mdash;the main principle, the motive and the meaning
of such characters as York, Norfolk, and Aumerle.&nbsp; The Gaveston
and the Mortimer of Marlowe are far more solid and definite figures
than these; yet none after that of Richard is more important to the
scheme of Shakespeare.&nbsp; They are fitful, shifting, vaporous: their
outlines change, withdraw, dissolve, and &ldquo;leave not a rack behind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They, not Antony, are like the clouds of evening described in the most
glorious of so many glorious passages put long afterwards by Shakespeare
into the mouth of his latest Roman hero.&nbsp; They &ldquo;cannot hold
this visible shape&rdquo; in which the poet at first presents them even
long enough to leave a distinct image, a decisive impression for better
or for worse, upon the mind&rsquo;s eye of the most simple and open-hearted
reader.&nbsp; They are ghosts, not men; <i>simulacra modis pallentia
miris</i>.&nbsp; You cannot descry so much as the original intention
of the artist&rsquo;s hand which began to draw and relaxed its hold
of the brush before the first lines were fairly traced.&nbsp; And in
the last, the worst and weakest scene of all, in which York pleads with
Bolingbroke for the death of the son whose mother pleads against her
husband for his life, there is a final relapse into rhyme and rhyming
epigram, into the &ldquo;jigging vein&rdquo; dried up (we might have
hoped) long since by the very glance of Marlowe&rsquo;s Apollonian scorn.&nbsp;
It would be easy, agreeable, and irrational to ascribe without further
evidence than its badness this misconceived and misshapen scene to some
other hand than Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is below the weakest,
the rudest, the hastiest scene attributable to Marlowe; it is false,
wrong, artificial beyond the worst of his bad and boyish work; but it
has a certain likeness for the worse to the crudest work of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
It is difficult to say to what depths of bad taste the writer of certain
passages in <i>Venus and Adonis</i> could not fall before his genius
or his judgment was full-grown.&nbsp; To invent an earlier play on the
subject and imagine this scene a surviving fragment, a floating waif
of that imaginary wreck, would in my opinion be an uncritical mode of
evading the question at issue.&nbsp; It must be regarded as the last
hysterical struggle of rhyme to maintain its place in tragedy; and the
explanation, I would fain say the excuse, of its reappearance may perhaps
be simply this; that the poet was not yet dramatist enough to feel for
each of his characters an equal or proportionate regard; to divide and
disperse his interest among the various crowd of figures which claim
each in its place, and each after its kind, fair and adequate share
of their creator&rsquo;s attention and sympathy.&nbsp; His present interest
was here wholly concentrated on the single figure of Richard; and when
that for the time was absent, the subordinate figures became to him
but heavy and vexatious encumbrances, to be shifted on and off the stage
with as much of haste and as little of labour as might be possible to
an impatient and uncertain hand.&nbsp; Now all tragic poets, I presume,
from &AElig;schylus the godlike father of them all to the last aspirant
who may struggle after the traces of his steps, have been poets before
they were tragedians; their lips have had power to sing before their
feet had strength to tread the stage, before their hands had skill to
paint or carve figures from the life.&nbsp; With Shakespeare it was
so as certainly as with Shelley, as evidently as with Hugo.&nbsp; It
is in the great comic poets, in Moli&egrave;re and in Congreve, <a name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42">{42}</a>
our own lesser Moli&egrave;re, so far inferior in breadth and depth,
in tenderness and strength, to the greatest writer of the &ldquo;great
age,&rdquo; yet so near him in science and in skill, so like him in
brilliance and in force;&mdash;it is in these that we find theatrical
instinct twin-born with imaginative impulse, dramatic power with inventive
perception.</p>
<p>In the second historic play which can be wholly ascribed to Shakespeare
we still find the poetic or rhetorical duality for the most part in
excess of the dramatic; but in <i>King Richard III</i>. the bonds of
rhyme at least are fairly broken.&nbsp; This only of all Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays belongs absolutely to the school of Marlowe.&nbsp; The influence
of the elder master, and that influence alone, is perceptible from end
to end.&nbsp; Here at last we can see that Shakespeare has decidedly
chosen his side.&nbsp; It is as fiery in passion, as single in purpose,
as rhetorical often though never so inflated in expression, as <i>Tamburlaine</i>
itself.&nbsp; It is doubtless a better piece of work than Marlowe ever
did; I dare not say, than Marlowe ever could have done.&nbsp; It is
not for any man to measure, above all is it not for any workman in the
field of tragic poetry lightly to take on himself the responsibility
or the authority to pronounce, what it is that Christopher Marlowe could
not have done; but, dying as he did and when he did, it is certain that
he has not left us a work so generally and so variously admirable as
<i>King Richard III</i>.&nbsp; As certain is it that but for him this
play could never have been written.&nbsp; At a later date the subject
would have been handled otherwise, had the poet chosen to handle it
at all; and in his youth he could not have treated it as he has without
the guidance and example of Marlowe.&nbsp; Not only are its highest
qualities of energy, of exuberance, of pure and lofty style, of sonorous
and successive harmonies, the very qualities that never fail to distinguish
those first dramatic models which were fashioned by his ardent hand;
the strenuous and single-handed grasp of character, the motion and action
of combining and contending powers, which here for the first time we
find sustained with equal and unfaltering vigour throughout the length
of a whole play, we perceive, though imperfectly, in the work of Marlowe
before we can trace them even as latent or infant forces in the work
of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>In the exquisite and delightful comedies of his earliest period we
can hardly discern any sign, any promise of them at all.&nbsp; One only
of these, the <i>Comedy of Errors</i>, has in it anything of dramatic
composition and movement; and what it has of these, I need hardly remind
the most cursory of students, is due by no means to Shakespeare.&nbsp;
What is due to him, and to him alone, is the honour of having embroidered
on the naked old canvas of comic action those flowers of elegiac beauty
which vivify and diversify the scene of Plautus as reproduced by the
art of Shakespeare.&nbsp; In the next generation so noble a poet as
Rotrou, whom perhaps it might not be inaccurate to call the French Marlowe,
and who had (what Marlowe had not) the gift of comic as well as of tragic
excellence, found nothing of this kind and little of any kind to add
to the old poet&rsquo;s admirable but arid sketch of farcical incident
or accident.&nbsp; But in this light and lovely work of the youth of
Shakespeare we find for the first time that strange and sweet admixture
of farce with fancy, of lyric charm with comic effect, which recurs
so often in his later work, from the date of <i>As You Like It</i> to
the date of the <i>Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i>, and which no later poet
had ventured to recombine in the same play till our own time had given
us, in the author of <i>Tragaldabas</i>, one who could alternate without
confusing the woodland courtship of Eliseo and Caprina with the tavern
braggardism of Grif and Minotoro.&nbsp; The sweetness and simplicity
of lyric or elegiac loveliness which fill and inform the scenes where
Adriana, her sister, and the Syracusan Antipholus exchange the expression
of their errors and their loves, belong to Shakespeare alone; and may
help us to understand how the young poet who at the outset of his divine
career had struck into this fresh untrodden path of poetic comedy should
have been, as we have seen that he was, loth to learn from another and
an alien teacher the hard and necessary lesson that this flowery path
would never lead him towards the loftier land of tragic poetry.&nbsp;
For as yet, even in the nominally or intentionally tragic and historic
work of the first period, we descry always and everywhere and still
preponderant the lyric element, the fantastic element, or even the elegiac
element.&nbsp; All these queens and heroines of history and tragedy
have rather an Ovidian than a Sophoclean grace of bearing and of speech.</p>
<p>The example afforded by the <i>Comedy of Errors</i> would suffice
to show that rhyme, however inadequate for tragic use, is by no means
a bad instrument for romantic comedy.&nbsp; In another of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
earliest works, which might almost be described as a lyrical farce,
rhyme plays also a great part; but the finest passage, the real crown
and flower of <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>, is the praise
or apology of love spoken by Biron in blank verse.&nbsp; This is worthy
of Marlowe for dignity and sweetness, but has also the grace of a light
and radiant fancy enamoured of itself, begotten between thought and
mirth, a child-god with grave lips and laughing eyes, whose inspiration
is nothing akin to Marlowe&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In this as in the overture
of the play and in its closing scene, but especially in the noble passage
which winds up for a year the courtship of Biron and Rosaline, the spirit
which informs the speech of the poet is finer of touch and deeper of
tone than in the sweetest of the serious interludes of the <i>Comedy
of Errors</i>.&nbsp; The play is in the main a yet lighter thing, and
more wayward and capricious in build, more formless and fantastic in
plot, more incomposite altogether than that first heir of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
comic invention, which on its own ground is perfect in its consistency,
blameless in composition and coherence; while in <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost</i> the fancy for the most part runs wild as the wind, and the
structure of the story is as that of a house of clouds which the wind
builds and unbuilds at pleasure.&nbsp; Here we find a very riot of rhymes,
wild and wanton in their half-grown grace as a troop of &ldquo;young
satyrs, tender-hoofed and ruddy-horned&rdquo;; during certain scenes
we seem almost to stand again by the cradle of new-born comedy, and
hear the first lisping and laughing accents run over from her baby lips
in bubbling rhyme; but when the note changes we recognise the speech
of gods.&nbsp; For the first time in our literature the higher key of
poetic or romantic comedy is finely touched to a fine issue.&nbsp; The
divine instrument fashioned by Marlowe for tragic purposes alone has
found at once its new sweet use in the hands of Shakespeare.&nbsp; The
way is prepared for <i>As You Like It</i> and the <i>Tempest</i>; the
language is discovered which will befit the lips of Rosalind and Miranda.</p>
<p>What was highest as poetry in the <i>Comedy of Errors</i> was mainly
in rhyme; all indeed, we might say, between the prelude spoken by &AElig;geon
and the appearance in the last scene of his wife: in <i>Love&rsquo;s
Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i> what was highest was couched wholly in blank
verse; in the <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> rhyme has fallen seemingly
into abeyance, and there are no passages of such elegiac beauty as in
the former, of such exalted eloquence as in the latter of these plays;
there is an even sweetness, a simple equality of grace in thought and
language which keeps the whole poem in tune, written as it is in a subdued
key of unambitious harmony.&nbsp; In perfect unity and keeping the composition
of this beautiful sketch may perhaps be said to mark a stage of advance,
a new point of work attained, a faint but sensible change of manner,
signalised by increased firmness of hand and clearness of outline.&nbsp;
Slight and swift in execution as it is, few and simple as are the chords
here struck of character and emotion, every shade of drawing and every
note of sound is at one with the whole scheme of form and music.&nbsp;
Here too is the first dawn of that higher and more tender humour which
was never given in such perfection to any man as ultimately to Shakespeare;
one touch of the by-play of Launce and his immortal dog is worth all
the bright fantastic interludes of Boyet and Adriano, Costard and Holofernes;
worth even half the sallies of Mercutio, and half the dancing doggrel
or broad-witted prose of either Dromio.&nbsp; But in the final poem
which concludes and crowns the first epoch of Shakespeare&rsquo;s work,
the special graces and peculiar glories of each that went before are
gathered together as in one garland &ldquo;of every hue and every scent.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The young genius of the master of all our poets finds its consummation
in the <i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>.&nbsp; The blank verse is
as full, sweet, and strong as the best of Biron&rsquo;s or Romeo&rsquo;s;
the rhymed verse as clear, pure, and true as the simplest and truest
melody of <i>Venus and Adonis</i> or the <i>Comedy of Errors</i>.&nbsp;
But here each kind of excellence is equal throughout; there are here
no purple patches on a gown of serge, but one seamless and imperial
robe of a single dye.&nbsp; Of the lyric or the prosaic part, the counterchange
of loves and laughters, of fancy fine as air and imagination high as
heaven, what need can there be for any one to shame himself by the helpless
attempt to say some word not utterly unworthy?&nbsp; Let it suffice
us to accept this poem as the landmark of our first stage, and pause
to look back from it on what lies behind us of partial or of perfect
work.</p>
<p>The highest point attained in this first period lies in the domain
of comedy or romance, and belongs as much to lyric as to dramatic poetry;
its sovereign quality is that of sweetness and springtide of fairy fancy
crossed with light laughter and light trouble that end in perfect music.&nbsp;
In history as in tragedy the master&rsquo;s hand has not yet come to
its full strength and skill; its touch is not yet wholly assured, its
work not yet wholly blameless.&nbsp; Besides the plays undoubtedly and
entirely due to the still growing genius of Shakespeare, we have taken
note but of two among those which bear the partial imprint of his hand.&nbsp;
The long-vexed question as to the authorship of the latter parts of
<i>King Henry VI</i>., in their earlier or later form, has not been
touched upon; nor do I design to reopen that perpetual source of debate
unstanchable and inexhaustible dispute by any length of scrutiny or
inquisition of detail.&nbsp; Two points must of course be taken for
granted: that Marlowe was more or less concerned in the production,
and Shakespeare in the revision of these plays; whether before or after
his additions to the original <i>First Part of King Henry VI</i>. we
cannot determine, though the absence of rhyme might seem to indicate
a later date for the recast of the <i>Contention</i>.&nbsp; But it is
noticeable that the style of Marlowe appears more vividly and distinctly
in passages of the reformed than of the unreformed plays.&nbsp; Those
famous lines, for example, which open the fourth act of the <i>Second
Part of King Henry VI</i>. are not to be found in the corresponding
scene of the first part of the <i>Contention</i>; yet, whether they
belong to the original sketch of the play, or were inserted as an afterthought
into the revised and expanded copy, the authorship of these verses is
surely unmistakable:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The gaudy, blabbing, and remorseful day<br />
Is crept into the bosom of the sea;<br />
And now loud howling wolves arouse the jades<br />
That drag the tragic melancholy night&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Aut Christophorus Marlowe, aut diabolus</i>; it is inconceivable
that any imitator but one should have had the power so to catch the
very trick of his hand, the very note of his voice, and incredible that
the one who might would have set himself to do so: for if this be not
indeed the voice and this the hand of Marlowe, then what we find in
these verses is not the fidelity of a follower, but the servility of
a copyist.&nbsp; No parasitic rhymester of past or present days who
feeds his starveling talent on the shreds and orts, &ldquo;the fragments,
scraps, the bits and greasy relics&rdquo; of another man&rsquo;s board,
ever uttered a more parrot-like note of plagiary.&nbsp; The very exactitude
of the repetition is a strong argument against the theory which attributes
it to Shakespeare.&nbsp; That he had much at starting to learn of Marlowe,
and that he did learn much&mdash;that in his earliest plays, and above
all in his earliest historic plays, the influence of the elder poet,
the echo of his style, the iteration of his manner, may perpetually
be traced&mdash;I have already shown that I should be the last to question;
but so exact an echo, so servile an iteration as this, I believe we
shall nowhere find in them.&nbsp; The sonorous accumulation of emphatic
epithets&mdash;as in the magnificent first verse of this passage&mdash;is
indeed at least as much a note of the young Shakespeare&rsquo;s style
as of his master&rsquo;s; but even were this one verse less in the manner
of the elder than the younger poet&mdash;and this we can hardly say
that it is&mdash;no single verse detached from its context can weigh
a feather against the full and flawless evidence of the whole speech.&nbsp;
And of all this there is nothing in the <i>Contention</i>; the scene
there opens in bald and flat nakedness of prose, striking at once into
the immediate matter of stage business without the decoration of a passing
epithet or a single trope.</p>
<p>From this sample it might seem that the main difficulty must be to
detect anywhere the sign-manual of Shakespeare, even in the best passages
of the revised play.&nbsp; On the other hand, it has not unreasonably
been maintained that even in the next scene of this same act in its
original form, and in all those following which treat of Cade&rsquo;s
insurrection, there is evidence of such qualities as can hardly be ascribed
to any hand then known but Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The forcible realism,
the simple vigour and lifelike humour of these scenes, cannot, it is
urged, be due to any other so early at work in the field of comedy.&nbsp;
A critic desirous to press this point might further insist on the likeness
or identity of tone between these and all later scenes in which Shakespeare
has taken on him to paint the action and passion of an insurgent populace.&nbsp;
With him, it might too plausibly be argued, the people once risen in
revolt for any just or unjust cause is always the mob, the unwashed
rabble, the swinish multitude; full as he is of wise and gracious tenderness
for individual character, of swift and ardent pity for personal suffering,
he has no deeper or finer feeling than scorn for &ldquo;the beast with
many heads&rdquo; that fawn and butt at bidding as they are swayed by
the vain and violent breath of any worthless herdsman.&nbsp; For the
drovers who guide and misguide at will the turbulent flocks of their
mutinous cattle his store of bitter words is inexhaustible; it is a
treasure-house of obloquy which can never be drained dry.&nbsp; All
this, or nearly all this, we must admit; but it brings us no nearer
to any but a floating and conjectural kind of solution.&nbsp; In the
earliest form known to us of this play it should seem that we have traces
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s handiwork, in the latest that we find evidence
of Marlowe&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But it would be something too extravagant
for the veriest wind-sucker among commentators to start a theory that
a revision was made of his original work by Marlowe after additions
had been made to it by Shakespeare; yet we have seen that the most unmistakable
signs of Marlowe&rsquo;s handiwork, the passages which show most plainly
the personal and present seal of his genius, belong to the play only
in its revised form; while there is no part of the whole composition
which can so confidently be assigned to Shakespeare as to the one man
then capable of such work, as can an entire and important episode of
the play in its unrevised state.&nbsp; Now the proposition that Shakespeare
was the sole author of both plays in their earliest extant shape is
refuted at once and equally from without and from within, by evidence
of tradition and by evidence of style.&nbsp; There is therefore proof
irresistible and unmistakable of at least a double authorship; and the
one reasonable conclusion left to us would seem to be this; that the
first edition we possess of these plays is a partial transcript of the
text as it stood after the first additions had been made by Shakespeare
to the original work of Marlowe and others; for that this original was
the work of more hands than one, and hands of notably unequal power,
we have again the united witness of traditional and internal evidence
to warrant our belief: and that among the omissions of this imperfect
text were certain passages of the original work, which were ultimately
restored in the final revision of the entire poem as it now stands among
the collected works of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>No competent critic who has given due study to the genius of Marlowe
will admit that there is a single passage of tragic or poetic interest
in either form of the text, which is beyond the reach of the father
of English tragedy: or, if there be one seeming exception in the expanded
and transfigured version of Clifford&rsquo;s monologue over his father&rsquo;s
corpse, which is certainly more in Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragic manner
than in Marlowe&rsquo;s, and in the style of a later period than that
in which he was on the whole apparently content to reproduce or to emulate
the tragic manner of Marlowe, there is at least but this one exception
to the general and absolute truth of the rule; and even this great tragic
passage is rather out of the range of Marlowe&rsquo;s style than beyond
the scope of his genius.&nbsp; In the later as in the earlier version
of these plays, the one manifest excellence of which we have no reason
to suppose him capable is manifest in the comic or prosaic scenes alone.&nbsp;
The first great rapid sketch of the dying cardinal, afterwards so nobly
enlarged and perfected on revision by the same or by a second artist,
is as clearly within the capacity of Marlowe as of Shakespeare; and
in either edition of the latter play, successively known as <i>The True
Tragedy of Richard Duke of York</i>, as the <i>Second Part of the Contention</i>,
and as the <i>Third Part of King Henry VI</i>., the dominant figure
which darkens all the close of the poem with presage of a direr day
is drawn by the same strong hand in the same tragic outline.&nbsp; From
the first to the last stage of the work there is no mark of change or
progress here; the whole play indeed has undergone less revision, as
it certainly needed less, than the preceding part of the <i>Contention</i>.&nbsp;
Those great verses which resume the whole spirit of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Richard&mdash;finer perhaps in themselves than any passage of the play
which bears his name&mdash;are wellnigh identical in either form of
the poem; but the reviser, with admirable judgment, has struck out,
whether from his own text or that of another, the line which precedes
them in the original sketch, where the passage runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I had no father, I am like no father;<br />
I have no brothers, I am like no brother;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(this reiteration is exactly in the first manner of our tragic drama;)</p>
<blockquote><p>And this word love, which greybeards term divine, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be an impertinence to transcribe the rest of a passage which
rings in the ear of every reader&rsquo;s memory; but it may be noted
that the erasure by which its effect is so singularly heightened with
the inborn skill of so divine an instinct is just such an alteration
as would be equally likely to occur to the original writer on glancing
over his printed text or to a poet of kindred power, who, while busied
in retouching and filling out the sketch of his predecessor, might be
struck by the opening for so great an improvement at so small a cost
of suppression.&nbsp; My own conjecture would incline to the belief
that we have here a perfect example of the manner in which Shakespeare
may be presumed, when such a task was set before him, to have dealt
with the text of Marlowe.&nbsp; That at the outset of his career he
was so employed, as well as on the texts of lesser poets, we have on
all hands as good evidence of every kind as can be desired; proof on
one side from the text of the revised plays, which are as certainly
in part the work of his hand as they are in part the work of another;
and proof on the opposite side from the open and clamorous charge of
his rivals, whose imputations can be made to bear no reasonable meaning
but this by the most violent ingenuity of perversion, and who presumably
were not persons of such frank imbecility, such innocent and infantine
malevolence, as to forge against their most dangerous enemy the pointless
and edgeless weapon of a charge which, if ungrounded, must have been
easier to refute than to devise.&nbsp; Assuming then that in common
with other young poets of his day he was thus engaged during the first
years of his connection with the stage, we should naturally have expected
to find him handling the text of Marlowe with more of reverence and
less of freedom than that of meaner men: ready, as in the <i>Contention</i>,
to clear away with no timid hand their weaker and more inefficient work,
to cancel and supplant it by worthier matter of his own; but when occupied
in recasting the verse of Marlowe, not less ready to confine his labour
to such slight and skilful strokes of art as that which has led us into
this byway of speculation; to the correction of a false note, the addition
of a finer touch, the perfection of a meaning half expressed or a tone
of half-uttered music; to the invigoration of sense and metre by substitution
of the right word for the wrong, of a fuller phrase for one feebler;
to the excision of such archaic and superfluous repetitions as are signs
of a cruder stage of workmanship, relics of a ruder period of style,
survivals of the earliest form or habit of dramatic poetry.&nbsp; Such
work as this, however humble in our present eyes, which look before
and after, would assuredly have been worthy of the workman and his task;
an office no less fruitful of profit, and no more unbeseeming the pupil
hand of the future master, than the subordinate handiwork of the young
Raffaelle or Leonardo on the canvas of Verrocchio or Perugino.</p>
<p>Of the doubtful or spurious plays which have been with more or less
show of reason ascribed to this first period of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
art, I have here no more to say than that I purpose in the proper place
to take account of the only two among them which bear the slightest
trace of any possible touch of his hand.&nbsp; For these two there is
not, as it happens, the least witness of tradition or outward likelihood
which might warrant us in assigning them a place apart from the rest,
and nearer the chance of reception into the rank that has been claimed
for them; while those plays in whose favour there is some apparent evidence
from without, such as the fact of early or even original attribution
to the master&rsquo;s hand, are, with one possible exception, utterly
beyond the pale of human consideration as at any stage whatever the
conceivable work of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Considering that his two attempts at narrative or rather semi-narrative
and semi-reflective poetry belong obviously to an early stage of his
earliest period, we may rather here than elsewhere take notice that
there are some curious points of coincidence for evil as for good between
the fortunes of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays and the fortunes of his poems.&nbsp;
In either case we find that some part at least of his earlier and inferior
work has fared better at the blind hands of chance and the brutish hands
of printers than some part at least of his riper and more precious products.&nbsp;
His two early poems would seem to have had the good hap of his personal
supervision in their passage through the press.&nbsp; Upon them, at
least since the time of Coleridge, who as usual has said on this subject
the first and the last word that need be said, it seems to me that fully
sufficient notice and fully adequate examination have been expended;
and that nothing at once new and true can now be profitably said in
praise or in dispraise of them.&nbsp; Of <i>A Lover&rsquo;s Complaint</i>,
marked as it is throughout with every possible sign suggestive of a
far later date and a far different inspiration, I have only space or
need to remark that it contains two of the most exquisitely Shakespearean
verses ever vouchsafed to us by Shakespeare, and two of the most execrably
euphuistic or dysphuistic lines ever inflicted on us by man.&nbsp; Upon
the Sonnets such a preposterous pyramid of presumptuous commentary has
long since been reared by the Cimmerian speculation and B&oelig;otian
&ldquo;brain-sweat&rdquo; of sciolists and scholiasts, that no modest
man will hope and no wise man will desire to add to the structure or
subtract from it one single brick of proof or disproof, theorem or theory.&nbsp;
As yet the one contemporary book which has ever been supposed to throw
any direct or indirect light on the mystic matter remains as inaccessible
and unhelpful to students as though it had never been published fifteen
years earlier than the date of their publication and four years before
the book in which Meres notices the circulation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&ldquo;sugared sonnets among his private friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would
be a most noble and thankworthy addition to a list of labours beyond
praise and benefits beyond price, if my honoured friend Dr. Grosart
could find the means to put a crown upon the achievements of his learning
and a seal upon the obligations of our gratitude by the one inestimable
boon long hoped for against hoping, and as yet but &ldquo;a vision in
a dream&rdquo; to the most learned and most loving of true Shakespearean
students; by the issue or reissue in its full and perfect likeness,
collated at last and complete, of <i>Willobie his Avisa</i>. <a name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63">{63}</a></p>
<p>It was long since more than time that the worthless and impudent
imposture called <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i> should be exposed and
expelled from its station at the far end of Shakespeare&rsquo;s poems.&nbsp;
What Coleridge said of Ben Jonson&rsquo;s epithet for &ldquo;turtle-footed
peace,&rdquo; we may say of the label affixed to this rag-picker&rsquo;s
bag of stolen goods: <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i> is a pretty title,
a very pretty title; pray what may it mean?&nbsp; In all the larcenous
little bundle of verse there is neither a poem which bears that name
nor a poem by which that name would be bearable.&nbsp; The publisher
of the booklet was like &ldquo;one Ragozine, a most notorious pirate&rdquo;;
and the method no less than the motive of his rascality in the present
instance is palpable and simple enough.&nbsp; Fired by the immediate
and instantly proverbial popularity of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Venus
and Adonis</i>, he hired, we may suppose, some ready hack of unclean
hand to supply him with three doggrel sonnets on the same subject, noticeable
only for their porcine quality of prurience: he procured by some means
a rough copy or an incorrect transcript of two genuine and unpublished
sonnets by Shakespeare, which with the acute instinct of a felonious
tradesman he laid atop of his worthless wares by way of gilding to their
base metal: he stole from the two years published text of <i>Love&rsquo;s
Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>, and reproduced with more or less mutilation
or corruption, the sonnet of Longavile, the &ldquo;canzonet&rdquo; of
Biron, and the far lovelier love-song of Dumaine.&nbsp; The rest of
the ragman&rsquo;s gatherings, with three most notable exceptions, is
little better for the most part than dry rubbish or disgusting refuse;
unless a plea may haply be put in for the pretty commonplaces of the
lines on a &ldquo;sweet rose, fair flower,&rdquo; and so forth; for
the couple of thin and pallid if tender and tolerable copies of verse
on &ldquo;Beauty&rdquo; and &ldquo;Good Night,&rdquo; or the passably
light and lively stray of song on &ldquo;crabbed age and youth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I need not say that those three exceptions are the stolen and garbled
work of Marlowe and of Barnfield, our elder Shelley and our first-born
Keats; the singer of Cynthia in verse well worthy of Endymion, who would
seem to have died as a poet in the same fatal year of his age that Keats
died as a man; the first adequate English laureate of the nightingale,
to be supplanted or equalled by none until the advent of his mightier
brother.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>The second period is that of perfection in comic and historic style.&nbsp;
The final heights and depths of tragedy, with all its reach of thought
and all its pulse of passion, are yet to be scaled and sounded; but
to this stage belongs the special quality of faultless, joyous, facile
command upon each faculty required of the presiding genius for service
or for sport.&nbsp; It is in the middle period of his work that the
language of Shakespeare is most limpid in its fullness, the style most
pure, the thought most transparent through the close and luminous raiment
of perfect expression.&nbsp; The conceits and crudities of the first
stage are outgrown and cast aside; the harshness and obscurity which
at times may strike us as among the notes of his third manner have as
yet no place in the flawless work of this second stage.&nbsp; That which
has to be said is not yet too great for perfection of utterance; passion
has not yet grappled with thought in so close and fierce an embrace
as to strain and rend the garment of words, though stronger and subtler
than ever was woven of human speech.&nbsp; Neither in his first nor
in his last stage would the style of Shakespeare, even were it possible
by study to reproduce it, be of itself a perfect and blameless model;
but his middle style, that in which the typical plays of his second
period are written, would be, if it were possible to imitate, the most
absolute pattern that could be set before man.&nbsp; I do not speak
of mere copyist&rsquo;s work, the parasitic knack of retailing cast
phrases, tricks and turns of accent, cadences and catchwords proper
only to the natural manner of the man who first came by instinct upon
them, and by instinct put them to use; I speak of that faithful and
fruitful discipleship of love with which the highest among poets and
the most original among workmen have naturally been always the first
to study and the most earnest to follow the footsteps of their greatest
precursors in that kind.&nbsp; And this only high and profitable form
of study and discipleship can set before itself, even in the work of
Shakespeare, no pattern so perfect, no model so absolute, as is afforded
by the style or manner of his second period.</p>
<p>To this stage belong by spiritual right if not by material, by rule
of poetic order if not by date of actual succession, the greatest of
his English histories and four of his greatest and most perfect comedies;
the four greatest we might properly call them, reserving for another
class the last divine triad of romantic plays which it is alike inaccurate
to number among tragedies or comedies proper: the <i>Winter&rsquo;s
Tale</i>, <i>Cymbeline</i>, and the <i>Tempest</i>, which belong of
course wholly to his last manner, or, if accuracy must be strained even
to pedantry, to the second manner of his third or final stage.&nbsp;
A single masterpiece which may be classed either among histories or
tragedies belongs to the middle period; and to this also we must refer,
if not the ultimate form, yet assuredly the first sketch at least of
that which is commonly regarded as the typical and supreme work of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
Three lesser comedies, one of them in great part the recast or rather
the transfiguration of an earlier poet&rsquo;s work, complete the list
of plays assignable to the second epoch of his genius.</p>
<p>The ripest fruit of historic or national drama, the consummation
and the crown of Shakespeare&rsquo;s labours in that line, must of course
be recognised and saluted by all students in the supreme and sovereign
trilogy of King Henry IV. and King Henry V.&nbsp; On a lower degree
only than this final and imperial work we find the two chronicle histories
which remain to be classed.&nbsp; In style as in structure they bear
witness of a power less perfect, a less impeccable hand.&nbsp; They
have less of perceptible instinct, less of vivid and vigorous utterance;
the breath of their inspiration is less continuous and less direct,
the fashion of their eloquence is more deliberate and more prepense;
there is more of study and structure apparent in their speech, and less
in their general scheme of action.&nbsp; Of all Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays they are the most rhetorical; there is more talk than song in
them, less poetry than oratory; more finish than form, less movement
than incident.&nbsp; Scene is laid upon scene, and event succeeds event,
as stone might be laid on stone and story might succeed story in a building
reared by mere might of human handiwork; not as in a city or temple
whose walls had risen of themselves to the lyric breath and stroke of
a greater than Amphion; moulded out of music by no rule or line of mortal
measure, with no sound of axe or anvil, but only of smitten strings:
built by harp and not by hand.</p>
<p>The lordly structure of these poems is the work of a royal workman,
full of masterdom and might, sublime in the state and strength of its
many mansions, but less perfect in proportion and less a&euml;rial in
build than the very highest fabrics fashioned after their own great
will by the supreme architects of song.&nbsp; Of these plays, and of
these alone among the maturer works of Shakespeare, it may be said that
the best parts are discernible from the rest, divisible by analysis
and separable by memory from the scenes which precede them or follow
and the characters which surround them or succeed.&nbsp; Constance and
Katherine rise up into remembrance apart from their environment and
above it, stand clear in our minds of the crowded company with which
the poet has begirt their central figures.&nbsp; In all other of his
great tragic works,&mdash;even in <i>Hamlet</i>, if we have grace and
sense to read it aright and not awry,&mdash;it is not of any single
person or separate passage that we think when we speak of it; it is
to the whole masterpiece that the mind turns at mention of its name.&nbsp;
The one entire and perfect chrysolite of <i>Othello</i> is neither Othello
nor Desdemona nor Iago, but each and all; the play of <i>Hamlet</i>
is more than Hamlet himself, the poem even here is too great to be resumed
in the person.&nbsp; But Constance is the jewel of <i>King John</i>,
and Katherine is the crowning blossom of <i>King Henry VIII</i>.&mdash;a
funeral flower as of &ldquo;marigolds on death-beds blowing,&rdquo;
an opal of as pure water as &ldquo;tears of perfect moan,&rdquo; with
fitful fire at its heart, ominous of evil and sorrow, set in a mourning
band of jet on the forefront of the poem, that the brow so circled may,
&ldquo;like to a title-leaf, foretell the nature of a tragic volume.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Not indeed that without these the ground would in either case be barren;
but that in either field our eye rests rather on these and other separate
ears of wheat that overtop the ranks, than on the waving width of the
whole harvest at once.&nbsp; In the one play our memory turns next to
the figures of Arthur and the Bastard, in the other to those of Wolsey
and his king: the residue in either case is made up of outlines more
lightly and slightly drawn.&nbsp; In two scenes the figure of King John
rises indeed to the highest height even of Shakespearean tragedy; for
the rest of the play the lines of his character are cut no deeper, the
features of his personality stand out in no sharper relief, than those
of Eleanor or the French king; but the scene in which he tempts Hubert
to the edge of the pit of hell sounds a deeper note and touches a subtler
string in the tragic nature of man than had been struck by any poet
save Dante alone, since the reign of the Greek tragedians.&nbsp; The
cunning and profound simplicity of the few last weighty words which
drop like flakes of poison that blister where they fall from the deadly
lips of the king is a new quality in our tragic verse; there was no
foretaste of such a thing in the passionate imagination which clothed
itself in the mighty music of Marlowe&rsquo;s burning song.&nbsp; The
elder master might indeed have written the magnificent speech which
ushers in with gradual rhetoric and splendid reticence the black suggestion
of a deed without a name; his hand might have woven with no less imperial
skill the elaborate raiment of words and images which wraps up in fold
upon fold, as with swaddling-bands of purple and golden embroidery,
the shapeless and miscreated birth of a murderous purpose that labours
into light even while it loathes the light and itself; but only Shakespeare
could give us the first sample of that more secret and terrible knowledge
which reveals itself in the brief heavy whispers that seal the commission
and sign the warrant of the king.&nbsp; Webster alone of all our tragic
poets has had strength to emulate in this darkest line of art the handiwork
of his master.&nbsp; We find nowhere such an echo or reflection of the
spirit of this scene as in the last tremendous dialogue of Bosola with
Ferdinand in the house of murder and madness, while their spotted souls
yet flutter between conscience and distraction, hovering for an hour
as with broken wings on the confines of either province of hell.&nbsp;
One pupil at least could put to this awful profit the study of so great
a model; but with the single and sublime exception of that other design
from the same great hand, which bares before us the mortal anguish of
Bracciano, no copy or imitation of the scene in which John dies by poison
has ever come near enough to evade the sentence it provokes.&nbsp; The
shrill tremulous agony of Fletcher&rsquo;s Valentinian is to the sullen
and slow death-pangs of Shakespeare&rsquo;s tyrant as the babble of
a suckling to the accents of a man.&nbsp; As far beyond the reach of
any but his maker&rsquo;s hand is the pattern of a perfect English warrior,
set once for all before the eyes of all ages in the figure of the noble
Bastard.&nbsp; The national side of Shakespeare&rsquo;s genius, the
heroic vein of patriotism that runs like a thread of living fire through
the world-wide range of his omnipresent spirit, has never, to my thinking,
found vent or expression to such glorious purpose as here.&nbsp; Not
even in Hotspur or Prince Hal has he mixed with more godlike sleight
of hand all the lighter and graver good qualities of the national character,
or compounded of them all so lovable a nature as this.&nbsp; In those
others we admire and enjoy the same bright fiery temper of soul, the
same buoyant and fearless mastery of fate or fortune, the same gladness
and glory of life made lovely with all the labour and laughter of its
full fresh days; but no quality of theirs binds our hearts to them as
they are bound to Philip&mdash;not by his loyal valour, his keen young
wit, his kindliness, constancy, readiness of service as swift and sure
in the day of his master&rsquo;s bitterest shame and shamefullest trouble
as in the blithest hour of battle and that first good fight which won
back his father&rsquo;s spoils from his father&rsquo;s slayer; but more
than all these, for that lightning of divine rage and pity, of tenderness
that speaks in thunder and indignation that makes fire of its tears,
in the horror of great compassion which falls on him, the tempest and
storm of a beautiful and godlike anger which shakes his strength of
spirit and bows his high heart down at sight of Arthur dead.&nbsp; Being
thus, as he is, the English masterwork of Shakespeare&rsquo;s hand,
we may well accept him as the best man known to us that England ever
made; the hero that Nelson must have been had he never come too near
Naples.</p>
<p>I am not minded to say much of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Arthur; there
are one or two figures in the world of his work of which there are no
words that would be fit or good to say.&nbsp; Another of these is Cordelia.&nbsp;
The place they have in our lives and thoughts is not one for talk; the
niche set apart for them to inhabit in our secret hearts is not penetrable
by the lights and noises of common day.&nbsp; There are chapels in the
cathedral of man&rsquo;s highest art as in that of his inmost life,
not made to be set open to the eyes and feet of the world.&nbsp; Love
and death and memory keep charge for us in silence of some beloved names.&nbsp;
It is the crowning glory of genius, the final miracle and transcendent
gift of poetry, that it can add to the number of these, and engrave
on the very heart of our remembrance fresh names and memories of its
own creation.</p>
<p>There is one younger child in this heavenly family of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
who sits side by side with Arthur in the secret places of our thought;
there are but two or three that I remember among the children of other
poets who may be named in the same year with them: as Fletcher&rsquo;s
Hengo, Webster&rsquo;s Giovanni, and Landor&rsquo;s C&aelig;sarion.&nbsp;
Of this princely trinity of boys the &ldquo;bud of Britain&rdquo; is
as yet the most famous flower; yet even in the broken words of childish
heroism that falter on his dying lips there is nothing of more poignant
pathos, more &ldquo;dearly sweet and bitter,&rdquo; than Giovanni&rsquo;s
talk of his dead mother and all her sleepless nights now ended for ever
in a sleep beyond tears or dreams.&nbsp; Perhaps the most nearly faultless
in finish and proportion of perfect nature among all the noble three
is Landor&rsquo;s portrait of the imperial and right Roman child of
C&aelig;sar and Cleopatra.&nbsp; I know not but this may be found in
the judgment of men to come wellnigh the most pathetic and heroic figure
bequeathed us after more than eighty years of a glorious life by the
indomitable genius of our own last Roman and republican poet.</p>
<p>We have come now to that point at the opening of the second stage
in his work where the supreme genius of all time begins first to meddle
with the mysteries and varieties of human character, to handle its finer
and more subtle qualities, to harmonise its more untuned and jarring
discords; giving here and thus the first proof of a power never shared
in like measure by the mightiest among the sons of men, a sovereign
and serene capacity to fathom the else unfathomable depths of spiritual
nature, to solve its else insoluble riddles, to reconcile its else irreconcilable
discrepancies.&nbsp; In his first stage Shakespeare had dropped his
plummet no deeper into the sea of the spirit of man than Marlowe had
sounded before him; and in the channel of simple emotion no poet could
cast surer line with steadier hand than he.&nbsp; Further down in the
dark and fiery depths of human pain and mortal passion no soul could
search than his who first rendered into speech the aspirations and the
agonies of a ruined and revolted spirit.&nbsp; And until Shakespeare
found in himself the strength of eyesight to read and the cunning of
handiwork to render those wider diversities of emotion and those further
complexities of character which lay outside the range of Marlowe, he
certainly cannot be said to have outrun the winged feet, outstripped
the fiery flight of his forerunner.&nbsp; In the heaven of our tragic
song the first-born star on the forehead of its herald god was not outshone
till the full midsummer meridian of that greater godhead before whom
he was sent to prepare a pathway for the sun.&nbsp; Through all the
forenoon of our triumphant day, till the utter consummation and ultimate
ascension of dramatic poetry incarnate and transfigured in the master-singer
of the world, the quality of his tragedy was as that of Marlowe&rsquo;s,
broad, single, and intense; large of hand, voluble of tongue, direct
of purpose.&nbsp; With the dawn of its latter epoch a new power comes
upon it, to find clothing and expression in new forms of speech and
after a new style.&nbsp; The language has put off its foreign decorations
of lyric and elegiac ornament; it has found already its infinite gain
in the loss of those sweet superfluous graces which encumbered the march
and enchained the utterance of its childhood.&nbsp; The figures which
it invests are now no more the types of a single passion, the incarnations
of a single thought.&nbsp; They now demand a scrutiny which tests the
power of a mind and tries the value of a judgment; they appeal to something
more than the instant apprehension which sufficed to respond to the
immediate claim of those that went before them.&nbsp; Romeo and Juliet
were simply lovers, and their names bring back to us no further thought
than of their love and the lovely sorrow of its end; Antony and Cleopatra
shall be before all things lovers, but the thought of their love and
its triumphant tragedy shall recall other things beyond number&mdash;all
the forces and all the fortunes of mankind, all the chance and all the
consequence that waited on their imperial passion, all the infinite
variety of qualities and powers wrought together and welded into the
frame and composition of that love which shook from end to end all nations
and kingdoms of the earth.</p>
<p>The same truth holds good in lighter matters; Biron and Rosaline
in comedy are as simply lovers and no more as were their counterparts
and coevals in tragedy: there is more in Benedick and Beatrice than
this simple quality of love that clothes itself in the strife of wits;
the injury done her cousin, which by the repercussion of its shock and
refraction of its effect serves to transfigure with such adorable indignation
and ardour of furious love and pity the whole bright light nature of
Beatrice, serves likewise by a fresh reflection and counterchange of
its consequence to exalt and enlarge the stature of her lover&rsquo;s
spirit after a fashion beyond the reach of Shakespeare in his first
stage.&nbsp; Mercutio again, like Philip, is a good friend and gallant
swordsman, quick-witted and hot-blooded, of a fiery and faithful temper,
loyal and light and swift alike of speech and swordstroke; and this
is all.&nbsp; But the character of the Bastard, clear and simple as
broad sunlight though it be, has in it other features than this single
and beautiful likeness of frank young manhood; his love of country and
loathing of the Church that would bring it into subjection are two sides
of the same national quality that has made and will always make every
Englishman of his type such another as he was in belief and in unbelief,
patriot and priest-hater; and no part of the design bears such witness
to the full-grown perfection of his creator&rsquo;s power and skill
as the touch that combines and fuses into absolute unity of concord
the high and various elements of faith in England, loyalty to the wretched
lord who has made him knight and acknowledged him kinsman, contempt
for his abjection at the foul feet of the Church, abhorrence of his
crime and constancy to his cause for something better worth the proof
of war than his miserable sake who hardly can be roused, even by such
exhortation as might put life and spirit into the dust of dead men&rsquo;s
bones, to bid his betters stand and strike in defence of the country
dishonoured by his reign.</p>
<p>It is this new element of variety in unity, this study of the complex
and diverse shades in a single nature, which requires from any criticism
worth attention some inquisition of character as complement to the investigation
of style.&nbsp; Analysis of any sort would be inapplicable to the actors
who bear their parts in the comic, the tragic or historic plays of the
first period.&nbsp; There is nothing in them to analyse; they are, as
we have seen, like all the characters represented by Marlowe, the embodiments
or the exponents of single qualities and simple forces.&nbsp; The question
of style also is therefore so far a simple question; but with the change
and advance in thought and all matter of spiritual study and speculation
this question also becomes complex, and inseparable, if we would pursue
it to any good end, from the analysis of character and subject.&nbsp;
In the debate on which we are now to enter, the question of style and
the question of character, or as we might say the questions of matter
and of spirit, are more than ever indivisible from each other, more
inextricably inwoven than elsewhere into the one most difficult question
of authorship which has ever been disputed in the dense and noisy school
or fought out in the wide and windy field of Shakespearean controversy.</p>
<p>There can be few serious students of Shakespeare who have not sometimes
felt that possibly the hardest problem involved in their study is that
which requires for its solution some reasonable and acceptable theory
as to the play of <i>King Henry VIII</i>.&nbsp; None such has ever yet
been offered; and I certainly cannot pretend to supply one.&nbsp; Perhaps
however it may be possible to do some service by an attempt to disprove
what is untenable, even though it should not be possible to produce
in its stead any positive proof of what we may receive as matter of
absolute faith.</p>
<p>The veriest tiro in criticism who knows anything of the subject in
hand must perceive, what is certainly not beyond a schoolboy&rsquo;s
range of vision, that the metre and the language of this play are in
great part so like the language and the metre of Fletcher that the first
and easiest inference would be to assume the partnership of that poet
in the work.&nbsp; In former days it was Jonson whom the critics and
commentators of their time saw good to select as the colleague or the
editor of Shakespeare; but a later school of criticism has resigned
the notion that the fifth act was retouched and adjusted by the author
of <i>Volpone</i> to the taste of his patron James.&nbsp; The later
theory is more plausible than this; the primary objection to it is that
it is too facile and superficial.&nbsp; It is waste of time to point
out with any intelligent and imaginative child with a tolerable ear
for metre who had read a little of the one and the other poet could
see for himself&mdash;that much of the play is externally as like the
usual style of Fletcher as it is unlike the usual style of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
The question is whether we can find one scene, one speech, one passage,
which in spirit, in scope, in purpose, bears the same or any comparable
resemblance to the work of Fletcher.&nbsp; I doubt if any man more warmly
admires a poet whom few can have studied more thoroughly than I; and
to whom, in spite of all sins of omission and commission,&mdash;and
many and grievous they are, beyond the plenary absolution of even the
most indulgent among critical confessors&mdash;I constantly return with
a fresh sense of attraction, which is constantly rewarded by a fresh
sense of gratitude and delight.&nbsp; It is assuredly from no wish to
pluck a leaf from his laurel, which has no need of foreign grafts or
stolen garlands from the loftier growth of Shakespeare&rsquo;s, that
I venture to question his capacity for the work assigned to him by recent
criticism.&nbsp; The speech of Buckingham, for example, on his way to
execution, is of course at first sight very like the finest speeches
of the kind in Fletcher; here is the same smooth and fluent declamation,
the same prolonged and persistent melody, which if not monotonous is
certainly not various; the same pure, lucid, perspicuous flow of simple
rather than strong and elegant rather than exquisite English; and yet,
if we set it against the best examples of the kind which may be selected
from such tragedies as <i>Bonduca</i> or <i>The False One</i>, against
the rebuke addressed by Caratach to his cousin or by C&aelig;sar to
the murderers of Pompey&mdash;and no finer instances of tragic declamation
can be chosen from the work of this great master of rhetorical dignity
and pathos&mdash;I cannot but think we shall perceive in it a comparative
severity and elevation which will be missed when we turn back from it
to the text of Fletcher.&nbsp; There is an aptness of phrase, an abstinence
from excess, a &ldquo;plentiful lack&rdquo; of mere flowery and superfluous
beauties, which we may rather wish than hope to find in the most famous
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s successors.&nbsp; But if not his work, we may
be sure it was his model; a model which he often approached, which he
often studied, but which he never attained.&nbsp; It is never for absolute
truth and fitness of expression, it is always for eloquence and sweetness,
for fluency and fancy, that we find the tragic scenes of Fletcher most
praiseworthy; and the motive or mainspring of interest is usually anything
but natural or simple.&nbsp; Now the motive here is as simple, the emotion
as natural as possible; the author is content to dispense with all the
violent or far-fetched or fantastic excitement from which Fletcher could
hardly ever bring himself completely to abstain.&nbsp; I am not speaking
here of those tragedies in which the hand of Beaumont is traceable;
to these, I need hardly say, the charge is comparatively inapplicable
which may fairly be brought against the unassisted works of his elder
colleague; but in any of the typical tragedies of Fletcher, in <i>Thierry
and Theodoret</i>, in <i>Valentinian</i>, in <i>The Double Marriage</i>,
the scenes which for power and beauty of style may reasonably be compared
with this of the execution of Buckingham will be found more forced in
situation, more fanciful in language than this.&nbsp; Many will be found
more beautiful, many more exciting; the famous interview of Thierry
with the veiled Ordella, and the scene answering to this in the fifth
act where Brunhalt is confronted with her dying son, will be at once
remembered by all dramatic students; and the parts of Lucina and Juliana
may each be described as a continuous arrangement of passionate and
pathetic effects.&nbsp; But in which of these parts and in which of
these plays shall we find a scene so simple, an effect so modest, a
situation so unforced as here? where may we look for the same temperance
of tone, the same control of excitement, the same steadiness of purpose?&nbsp;
If indeed Fletcher could have written this scene, or the farewell of
Wolsey to his greatness, or his parting scene with Cromwell, he was
perhaps not a greater poet, but he certainly was a tragic writer capable
of loftier self-control and severer self-command, than he has ever shown
himself elsewhere.</p>
<p>And yet, if this were all, we might be content to believe that the
dignity of the subject and the high example of his present associate
had for once lifted the natural genius of Fletcher above itself.&nbsp;
But the fine and subtle criticism of Mr. Spedding has in the main, I
think, successfully and clearly indicated the lines of demarcation undeniably
discernible in this play between the severer style of certain scenes
or speeches and the laxer and more fluid style of others; between the
graver, solider, more condensed parts of the apparently composite work,
and those which are clearer, thinner, more diffused and diluted in expression.&nbsp;
If under the latter head we had to class such passages only as the dying
speech of Buckingham and the christening speech of Cranmer, it might
after all be almost impossible to resist the internal evidence of Fletcher&rsquo;s
handiwork.&nbsp; Certainly we hear the same soft continuous note of
easy eloquence, level and limpid as a stream of crystalline transparence,
in the plaintive adieu of the condemned statesman and the panegyrical
prophecy of the favoured prelate.&nbsp; If this, I say, were all, we
might admit that there is nothing&mdash;I have already admitted it&mdash;in
either passage beyond the poetic reach of Fletcher.&nbsp; But on the
hypothesis so ably maintained by the editor of Bacon there hangs no
less a consequence than this: that we must assign to the same hand the
crowning glory of the whole poem, the death-scene of Katherine.&nbsp;
Now if Fletcher could have written that scene&mdash;a scene on which
the only criticism ever passed, the only commendation ever bestowed,
by the verdict of successive centuries, has been that of tears and silence&mdash;if
Fletcher could have written a scene so far beyond our applause, so far
above our acclamation, then the memory of no great poet has ever been
so grossly wronged, so shamefully defrauded of its highest claim to
honour.&nbsp; But, with all reverence for that memory, I must confess
that I cannot bring myself to believe it.&nbsp; Any explanation appears
to me more probable than this.&nbsp; Considering with what care every
relic of his work was once and again collected by his posthumous editors&mdash;even
to the attribution, not merely of plays in which he can have taken only
the slightest part, but of plays in which we know that he had no share
at all&mdash;I cannot believe that his friends would have let by far
the brightest jewel in his crown rest unreclaimed in the then less popular
treasure-house of Shakespeare.&nbsp; Belief or disbelief of this kind
is however but a sandy soil for conjecture to build upon.&nbsp; Whether
or not his friends would have reclaimed for him the credit of this scene,
had they known it (as they must have known it) to be his due, I must
repeat that such a miraculous example of a man&rsquo;s genius for once
transcending itself and for ever eclipsing all its other achievements
appears to me beyond all critical, beyond all theological credulity.&nbsp;
Pathos and concentration are surely not among the dominant notes of
Fletcher&rsquo;s style or the salient qualities of his intellect.&nbsp;
Except perhaps in the beautiful and famous passage where Hengo dies
in his uncle&rsquo;s arms, I doubt whether in any of the variously and
highly coloured scenes played out upon the wide and shifting stage of
his fancy the genius of Fletcher has ever unlocked the source of tears.&nbsp;
Bellario and Aspatia were the children of his younger colleague; at
least, after the death of Beaumont we meet no such figures on the stage
of Fletcher.&nbsp; In effect, though Beaumont had a gift of grave sardonic
humour which found especial vent in burlesques of the heroic style and
in the systematic extravagance of such characters as Bessus, <a name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89">{89}</a>
yet he was above all things a tragic poet; and though Fletcher had great
power of tragic eloquence and passionate effusion, yet his comic genius
was of a rarer and more precious quality; one <i>Spanish Curate</i>
is worth many a <i>Valentinian</i>; as, on the other hand, one <i>Philaster</i>
is worth many a <i>Scornful Lady</i>.&nbsp; Now there is no question
here of Beaumont; and there is no question that the passage here debated
has been taken to the heart of the whole world and baptized in the tears
of generations as no work of Fletcher&rsquo;s has ever been.&nbsp; That
Beaumont could have written it I do not believe; but I am wellnigh assured
that Fletcher could not.&nbsp; I can scarcely imagine that the most
fluid sympathy, the &ldquo;hysteric passion&rdquo; most easily distilled
from the eyes of reader or spectator, can ever have watered with its
tears the scene or the page which sets forth, however eloquently and
effectively, the sorrows and heroisms of Ordella, Juliana, or Lucina.&nbsp;
Every success but this I can well believe them, as they assuredly deserve,
to have attained.</p>
<p>To this point then we have come, as to the crucial point at issue;
and looking back upon those passages of the play which first suggest
the handiwork of Fletcher, and which certainly do now and then seem
almost identical in style with his, I think we shall hardly find the
difference between these and other parts of the same play so wide and
so distinct as the difference between the undoubted work of Fletcher
and the undoubted work of Shakespeare.&nbsp; What that difference is
we are fortunately able to determine with exceptional certitude, and
with no supplementary help from conjecture of probabilities.&nbsp; In
the play which is undoubtedly a joint work of these poets the points
of contact and the points of disunion are unmistakable by the youngest
eye.&nbsp; In the very last scene of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, we
can tell with absolute certainty what speeches were appended or interpolated
by Fletcher; we can pronounce with positive conviction what passages
were completed and what parts were left unfinished by Shakespeare.&nbsp;
Even on Mr. Spedding&rsquo;s theory it can hardly be possible to do
as much for <i>King Henry VIII</i>.&nbsp; The lines of demarcation,
however visible or plausible, are fainter by far than these.&nbsp; It
is certainly not much less strange to come upon such passages in the
work of Shakespeare as the speeches of Buckingham and Cranmer than it
would be to encounter in the work of Sophocles a sample of the later
and laxer style of Euripides; to meet for instance in the <i>Antigone</i>
with a passage which might pass muster as an extract from the <i>Iphigenia
in Aulis</i>.&nbsp; In metrical effects the style of the lesser English
poet is an exact counterpart of the style of the lesser Greek; there
is the same comparative tenuity and fluidity of verse, the same excess
of short unemphatic syllables, the same solution of the graver iambic
into soft overflow of lighter and longer feet which relaxes and dilutes
the solid harmony of tragic metre with notes of a more facile and feminine
strain.&nbsp; But in <i>King Henry VIII</i>. it should be remarked that
though we not unfrequently find the same preponderance as in Fletcher&rsquo;s
work of verses with a double ending&mdash;which in English verse at
least are not in themselves feminine, and need not be taken to constitute,
as in Fletcher&rsquo;s case they do, a note of comparative effeminacy
or relaxation in tragic style&mdash;we do not find the perpetual predominance
of those triple terminations so peculiarly and notably dear to that
poet; <a name="citation92"></a><a href="#footnote92">{92}</a> so that
even by the test of the metre-mongers who would reduce the whole question
at issue to a point which might at once be solved by the simple process
of numeration the argument in favour of Fletcher can hardly be proved
tenable; for the metre which evidently has one leading quality in common
with his is as evidently wanting in another at least as marked and as
necessary to establish&mdash;if established it can be by any such test
taken singly and, apart from all other points of evidence&mdash;the
collaboration of Fletcher with Shakespeare in this instance.&nbsp; And
if the proof by mere metrical similitude is thus imperfect, there is
here assuredly no other kind of test which may help to fortify the argument
by any suggestion of weight even comparable to this.&nbsp; In those
passages which would seem most plausibly to indicate the probable partnership
of Fletcher, the unity and sustained force of the style keep it generally
above the average level of his; there is less admixture or intrusion
of lyric or elegiac quality; there is more of temperance and proportion
alike in declamation and in debate.&nbsp; And throughout the whole play,
and under all the diversity of composite subject and conflicting interest
which disturbs the unity of action, there is a singleness of spirit,
a general unity or concord of inner tone, in marked contrast to the
utter discord and discrepancy of the several sections of <i>The Two
Noble Kinsmen</i>.&nbsp; We admit, then, that this play offers us in
some not unimportant passages the single instance of a style not elsewhere
precisely or altogether traceable in Shakespeare; that no exact parallel
to it can be found among his other plays; and that if not the partial
work it may certainly be taken as the general model of Fletcher in his
tragic poetry.&nbsp; On the other hand, we contend that its exceptional
quality might perhaps be explicable as a tentative essay in a new line
by one who tried so many styles before settling into his latest; and
that, without far stronger, clearer, and completer proof than has yet
been or can ever be advanced, the question is not solved but merely
evaded by the assumption of a double authorship.</p>
<p>By far the ablest argument based upon a wider ground of reason or
of likelihood than this of mere metre that has yet been advanced in
support of the theory which would attribute a part of this play to some
weaker hand than Shakespeare&rsquo;s is due to the study of a critic
whose name&mdash;already by right of inheritance the most illustrious
name of his age and ours&mdash;is now for ever attached to that of Shakespeare
himself by right of the highest service ever done and the noblest duty
ever paid to his memory.&nbsp; The untimely death which removed beyond
reach of our thanks for all he had done and our hopes for all he might
do, the man who first had given to France the first among foreign poets&mdash;son
of the greatest Frenchman and translator of the greatest Englishman&mdash;was
only in this not untimely, that it forbore him till the great and wonderful
work was done which has bound two deathless names together by a closer
than the common link that connects the names of all sovereign poets.&nbsp;
Among all classic translations of the classic works of the world, I
know of none that for absolute mastery and perfect triumph over all
accumulation of obstacles, for supreme dominion over supreme difficulty,
can be matched with the translation of Shakespeare by Fran&ccedil;ois-Victor
Hugo; unless a claim of companionship may perchance be put in for Urquhart&rsquo;s
unfinished version of Rabelais.&nbsp; For such success in the impossible
as finally disproves the right of &ldquo;that fool of a word&rdquo;
to existence&mdash;at least in the world of letters&mdash;the two miracles
of study and of sympathy which have given Shakespeare to the French
and Rabelais to the English, and each in his habit as he lived, may
take rank together in glorious rivalry beyond eyeshot of all past or
future competition.</p>
<p>Among the essays appended to the version of Shakespeare which they
complete and illustrate, that which deals with the play now in question
gives as ample proof as any other of the sound and subtle insight brought
to bear by the translator upon the object of his labour and his love.&nbsp;
His keen and studious intuition is here as always not less notable and
admirable than his large and solid knowledge, his full and lucid comprehension
at once of the text and of the history of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays;
and if his research into the inner details of that history may seem
ever to have erred from the straight path of firm and simple certainty
into some dubious byway of theory or conjecture, we may be sure at least
that no lack of learning or devotion, of ardour or intelligence, but
more probably some noble thought that was fathered by a noble wish to
do honour to Shakespeare, has led him to attribute to his original some
quality foreign to the text, or to question the authenticity of what
for love of his author he might not wish to find in it.&nbsp; Thus he
would reject the main part of the fifth act as the work of a mere court
laureate, an official hack or hireling employed to anoint the memory
of an archbishop and lubricate the steps of a throne with the common
oil of dramatic adulation; and finding it in either case a task alike
unworthy of Shakespeare to glorify the name of Cranmer or to deify the
names of the queen then dead and the king yet living, it is but natural
that he should be induced by an unconscious bias or prepossession of
the will to depreciate the worth of the verse sent on work fitter for
ushers and embalmers and the general valetry or varletry of Church and
State.&nbsp; That this fifth act is unequal in point of interest to
the better part of the preceding acts with which it is connected by
so light and loose a tie of convenience is as indisputable as that the
style of the last scene savours now and then, and for some space together,
more strongly than ever of Fletcher&rsquo;s most especial and distinctive
qualities, or that the whole structure of the play if judged by any
strict rule of pure art is incomposite and incongruous, wanting in unity,
consistency, and coherence of interest.&nbsp; The fact is that here
even more than in <i>King John</i> the poet&rsquo;s hands were hampered
by a difficulty inherent in the subject.&nbsp; To an English and Protestant
audience, fresh from the passions and perils of reformation and reaction,
he had to present an English king at war with the papacy, in whom the
assertion of national independence was incarnate; and to the sympathies
of such an audience it was a matter of mere necessity for him to commend
the representative champion of their cause by all means which he could
compel into the service of his aim.&nbsp; Yet this object was in both
instances all but incompatible with the natural and necessary interest
of the plot.&nbsp; It was inevitable that this interest should in the
main be concentrated upon the victims of the personal or national policy
of either king; upon Constance and Arthur, upon Katherine and Wolsey.&nbsp;
Where these are not, either apparent in person on the stage, or felt
in their influence upon the speech and action of the characters present,
the pulse of the poem beats fainter and its forces begin to flag.&nbsp;
In <i>King John</i> this difficulty was met and mastered, these double
claims of the subject of the poem and the object of the poet were satisfied
and harmonised, by the effacement of John and the substitution of Faulconbridge
as the champion of the national cause and the protagonist of the dramatic
action.&nbsp; Considering this play in its double aspect of tragedy
and history, we might say that the English hero becomes the central
figure of the poem as seen from its historic side, while John remains
the central figure of the poem as seen from its tragic side; the personal
interest that depends on personal crime and retribution is concentrated
on the agony of the king; the national interest which he, though the
eponymous hero of the poem, was alike inadequate as a craven and improper
as a villain to sustain and represent in the eyes of the spectators
was happily and easily transferred to the one person of the play who
could properly express within the compass of its closing act at once
the protest against papal pretension, the defiance of foreign invasion,
and the prophetic assurance of self-dependent life and self-sufficing
strength inherent in the nation then fresh from a fiercer trial of its
quality, which an audience of the days of Queen Elizabeth would justly
expect from the poet who undertook to set before them in action the
history of the days of King John.&nbsp; That history had lately been
brought upon the stage under the hottest and most glaring light that
could be thrown on it by the fire of fanatical partisanship; <i>The
Troublesome Reign of King John</i>, weakest and most wooden of all wearisome
chronicles that ever cumbered the boards, had in it for sole principle
of life its power of congenial appeal to the same blatant and vulgar
spirit of Protestantism which inspired it.&nbsp; In all the flat interminable
morass of its tedious and tuneless verse I can find no blade or leaf
of living poetic growth, no touch but one of nature or of pathos, where
Arthur dying would fain send a last thought in search of his mother.&nbsp;
From this play Shakespeare can have got neither hint nor help towards
the execution of his own; the crude rough sketch of the Bastard as he
brawls and swaggers through the long length of its scenes is hardly
so much as the cast husk or chrysalid of the noble creature which was
to arise and take shape for ever at the transfiguring touch of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
In the case of <i>King Henry VIII</i>. he had not even such a blockish
model as this to work from.&nbsp; The one preceding play known to me
which deals professedly with the same subject treats of quite other
matters than are handled by Shakespeare, and most notably with the scholastic
adventures or misadventures of Edward Prince of Wales and his whipping-boy
Ned Browne.&nbsp; A fresh and wellnigh a plausible argument might be
raised by the critics who deny the unity of authorship in King Henry
VIII., on the ground that if Shakespeare had completed the work himself
he would surely not have let slip the occasion to introduce one of the
most famous and popular of all court fools in the person of Will Summers,
who might have given life and relief to the action of many scenes now
unvaried and unbroken in their gravity of emotion and event.&nbsp; Shakespeare,
one would say, might naturally have been expected to take up and remodel
the well-known figure of which his humble precursor could give but a
rough thin outline, yet sufficient it should seem to attract the tastes
to which it appealed; for this or some other quality of seasonable attraction
served to float the now forgotten play of Samuel Rowley through several
editions.&nbsp; The central figure of the huge hot-headed king, with
his gusts of stormy good humour and peals of burly oaths which might
have suited &ldquo;Garagantua&rsquo;s mouth&rdquo; and satisfied the
requirements of Hotspur, appeals in a ruder fashion to the survival
of the same sympathies on which Shakespeare with a finer instinct as
evidently relied; the popular estimate of the bluff and brawny tyrant
&ldquo;who broke the bonds of Rome&rdquo; was not yet that of later
historians, though doubtless neither was it that of the writer or writers
who would champion him to the utterance.&nbsp; Perhaps the opposite
verdicts given by the instinct of the people on &ldquo;bluff King Hal&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Bloody Mary&rdquo; may be understood by reference to a famous
verse of Juvenal.&nbsp; The wretched queen was sparing of noble blood
and lavish of poor men&rsquo;s lives&mdash;<i>cerdonibus timenda</i>;
and the curses under which her memory was buried were spared by the
people to her father, <i>Lamiarum c&aelig;de madenti</i>.&nbsp; In any
case, the humblest not less than the highest of the poets who wrote
under the reign of his daughter found it safe to present him in a popular
light before an audience of whose general prepossession in his favour
William Shakespeare was no slower to take advantage than Samuel Rowley.</p>
<p>The two plays we have just discussed have one quality of style in
common which has already been noted; that in them rhetoric is in excess
of action or passion, and far in excess of poetry.&nbsp; They are not
as yet perfect examples of his second manner, though far ahead of his
first stage in performance as in promise.&nbsp; Compared with the full
and living figure of Katherine or of Constance, the study of Margaret
of Anjou is the mere sketch of a poet still in his pupilage: John and
Henry, Faulconbridge and Wolsey, are designs beyond reach of the hand
which drew the second and third Richard without much background or dramatic
perspective.&nbsp; But the difficulties inherent in either subject are
not surmounted throughout with absolute equality of success; the very
point of appeal to the sympathy and excitement of the time may have
been something of a disturbing force in the composition of the work&mdash;a
loadstone rock indeed, of tempting attraction to the patriot as well
as to the playwright, but possibly capable of proving in some measure
a rock of offence to the poet whose ship was piloted towards it.&nbsp;
His perfect triumph in the field of patriotic drama, coincident with
the perfect maturity of his comic genius and his general style, has
now to show itself.</p>
<p>The great national trilogy which is at once the flower of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
second period and the crown of his achievements in historic drama&mdash;unless
indeed we so far depart from the established order and arrangement of
his works as to include his three Roman plays in the same class with
these English histories&mdash;offers perhaps the most singular example
known to us of the variety in fortune which befell his works on their
first appearance in print.&nbsp; None of these had better luck in that
line at starting than <i>King Henry IV</i>.; none had worse than <i>King
Henry V</i>.&nbsp; With <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, the <i>Merry Wives
of Windsor</i>, and <i>Hamlet</i>, it shares the remarkable and undesirable
honour of having been seized and boarded by pirates even before it had
left the dockyard.&nbsp; The masterbuilder&rsquo;s hands had not yet
put the craft into seaworthy condition when she was overhauled by these
Kidds and Blackbeards of the press.&nbsp; Of those four plays, the two
tragedies at least were thoroughly recast, and rewritten from end to
end: the pirated editions giving us a transcript, more or less perfect
or imperfect, accurate or corrupt, of the text as it first came from
the poet&rsquo;s hand; a text to be afterwards indefinitely modified
and incalculably improved.&nbsp; Not quite so much can be said of the
comedy, which certainly stood in less need of revision, and probably
would not have borne it so well; nevertheless every little passing touch
of the reviser&rsquo;s hand is here also a noticeable mark of invigoration
and improvement.&nbsp; But <i>King Henry V</i>., we may fairly say,
is hardly less than transformed.&nbsp; Not that it has been recast after
the fashion of <i>Hamlet</i>, or even rewritten after the fashion of
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>; but the corruptions and imperfections of the
pirated text are here more flagrant than in any other instance; while
the general revision of style by which it is at once purified and fortified
extends to every nook and corner of the restored and renovated building.&nbsp;
Even had we, however, a perfect and trustworthy transcript of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
original sketch for this play, there can be little doubt that the rough
draught would still prove almost as different from the final masterpiece
as is the soiled and ragged canvas now before us, on which we trace
the outline of figures so strangely disfigured, made subject to such
rude extremities of defacement and defeature.&nbsp; There is indeed
less difference between the two editions in the comic than in the historic
scenes; the pirates were probably more careful to furnish their market
with a fair sample of the lighter than of the graver ware supplied by
their plunder of the poet; Fluellen and Pistol lose less through their
misusage than the king; and the king himself is less maltreated when
he talks plain prose with his soldiers than when he chops blank verse
with his enemies or his lords.&nbsp; His rough and ready courtship of
the French princess is a good deal expanded as to length, but (if I
dare say so) less improved and heightened in tone than we might well
have wished and it might well have borne; in either text the Hero&rsquo;s
addresses savour rather of a ploughman than a prince, and his finest
courtesies are clownish though not churlish.&nbsp; We may probably see
in this rather a concession to the appetite of the groundlings than
an evasion of the difficulties inherent in the subject-matter of the
scene; too heavy as these might have been for another, we can conceive
of none too hard for the magnetic tact and intuitive delicacy of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
judgment and instinct.&nbsp; But it must fairly and honestly be admitted
that in this scene we find as little of the charm and humour inseparable
from the prince as of the courtesy and dignity to be expected from the
king.</p>
<p>It should on the other hand be noted that the finest touch in the
comic scenes, if not the finest in the whole portrait of Falstaff, is
apparently an afterthought, a touch added on revision of the original
design.&nbsp; In the first scene of the second act Mrs. Quickly&rsquo;s
remark that &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll yield the crow a pudding one of these
days&rdquo; is common to both versions of the play; but the six words
following are only to be found in the revised edition; and these six
words the very pirates could hardly have passed over or struck out.&nbsp;
They are not such as can drop from the text of a poet unperceived by
the very dullest and horniest of human eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;The king has
killed his heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here is the point in Falstaff&rsquo;s
nature so strangely overlooked by the man of all men who we should have
said must be the first to seize and to appreciate it.&nbsp; It is as
grievous as it is inexplicable that the Shakespeare of France&mdash;the
most infinite in compassion, in &ldquo;conscience and tender heart,&rdquo;
of all great poets in all ages and all nations of the world&mdash;should
have missed the deep tenderness of this supreme and subtlest touch in
the work of the greatest among his fellows.&nbsp; Again, with anything
but &ldquo;damnable&rdquo; iteration, does Shakespeare revert to it
before the close of this very scene.&nbsp; Even Pistol and Nym can see
that what now ails their old master is no such ailment as in his prosperous
days was but too liable to &ldquo;play the rogue with his great toe.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The king hath run bad humours on the knight&rdquo;: &ldquo;his
heart is fracted, and corroborate.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is not thus merely
through the eclipse of that brief mirage, that fair prospect &ldquo;of
Africa, and golden joys,&rdquo; in view of which he was ready to &ldquo;take
any man&rsquo;s horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; This it is that distinguishes Falstaff
from Panurge; that lifts him at least to the moral level of Sancho Panza.&nbsp;
I cannot but be reluctant to set the verdict of my own judgment against
that of Victor Hugo&rsquo;s; I need none to remind me what and who he
is whose judgment I for once oppose, and what and who am I that I should
oppose it; that he is he, and I am but myself; yet against his classification
of Falstaff, against his definition of Shakespeare&rsquo;s unapproached
and unapproachable masterpiece in the school of comic art and humouristic
nature, I must and do with all my soul and strength protest.&nbsp; The
admirable phrase of &ldquo;swine-centaur&rdquo; (<i>centaure du porc</i>)
is as inapplicable to Falstaff as it is appropriate to Panurge.&nbsp;
Not the third person but the first in date of that divine and human
trinity of humourists whose names make radiant for ever the Century
of their new-born glory&mdash;not Shakespeare but Rabelais is responsible
for the creation or the discovery of such a type as this.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Suum
cuique</i> is our Roman justice&rdquo;; the gradation from Panurge to
Falstaff is not downward but upward; though it be Victor Hugo&rsquo;s
very self who asserts the contrary. <a name="citation108"></a><a href="#footnote108">{108}</a>&nbsp;
Singular as may seem the collocation of the epithet &ldquo;moral&rdquo;
with the name &ldquo;Falstaff,&rdquo; I venture to maintain my thesis;
that in point of feeling, and therefore of possible moral elevation,
Falstaff is as undeniably the superior of Sancho as Sancho is unquestionably
the superior of Panurge.&nbsp; The natural affection of Panurge is bounded
by the self-same limits as the natural theology of Polyphemus; the love
of the one, like the faith of the other, begins and ends alike at one
point;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself,<br />
And this great belly, first of deities;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(in which line, by the way, we may hear as it were a first faint
prelude of the great proclamation to come&mdash;the hymn of praise and
thanksgiving for the coronation day of King Gaster; whose laureate,
we know, was as lovingly familiar with the Polyphemus of Euripides as
Shakespeare with his own Pantagruel.)&nbsp; In Sancho we come upon a
creature capable of love&mdash;but not of such love as kills or helps
to kill, such love as may end or even as may seem to end in anything
like heartbreak.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now abideth Rabelais, Cervantes, Shakespeare,
these three; but the greatest of these is Shakespeare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would fain score yet another point in the fat knight&rsquo;s favour;
&ldquo;I have much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Rabelais, evangelist and prophet of the Resurrection of the Flesh (so
long entombed, ignored, repudiated, misconstrued, vilified, by so many
generations and ages of Galilean preachers and Pharisaic schoolmen)&mdash;Rabelais
was content to paint the flesh merely, in its honest human reality&mdash;human
at least, if also bestial; in its frank and rude reaction against the
half brainless and wholly bloodless teachers whose doctrine he himself
on the one hand, and Luther on the other, arose together to smite severally&mdash;to
smite them hip and thigh, even till the going down of the sun; the mock
sun or marshy meteor that served only to deepen the darkness encompassing
on every side the doubly dark ages&mdash;the ages of monarchy and theocracy,
the ages of death and of faith.&nbsp; To Panurge, therefore, it was
unnecessary and it might have seemed inconsequent to attribute other
gifts or functions than are proper to such intelligence as may accompany
the appetites of an animal.&nbsp; That most irreverend father in God,
Friar John, belongs to a higher class in the moral order of being; and
he much rather than his fellow-voyager and penitent is properly comparable
with Falstaff.&nbsp; It is impossible to connect the notion of rebuke
with the sins of Panurge.&nbsp; The actual lust and gluttony, the imaginary
cowardice of Falstaff, have been gravely and sharply rebuked by critical
morality; we have just noted a too recent and too eminent example of
this; but what mortal ever dreamed of casting these qualities in the
teeth of his supposed counterpart?&nbsp; The difference is as vast between
Falstaff on the field of battle and Panurge on the storm-tossed deck
as between Falstaff and Hotspur, Panurge and Friar John.&nbsp; No man
could show cooler and steadier nerve than is displayed in either case&mdash;by
the lay as well as the clerical namesake of the fourth evangelist.&nbsp;
If ever fruitless but endless care was shown to prevent misunderstanding,
it was shown in the pains taken by Shakespeare to obviate the misconstruction
which would impute to Falstaff the quality of a Parolles or a Bobadil,
a Bessus or a Moron.&nbsp; The delightful encounter between the jester
and the bear in the crowning interlude of <i>La Princesse d&rsquo;&Eacute;lide</i>
shows once more, I may remark, that Moli&egrave;re had sat at the feet
of Rabelais as delightedly as Shakespeare before him.&nbsp; Such rapturous
inebriety or Olympian incontinence of humour only fires the blood of
the graver and less exuberant humourist when his lips are still warm
and wet from the well-spring of the <i>Dive Bouteille</i>.</p>
<p>It is needless to do over again the work which was done, and well
done, a hundred years since, by the writer whose able essay in vindication
and exposition of the genuine character of Falstaff elicited from Dr.
Johnson as good a jest and as bad a criticism as might have been expected.&nbsp;
His argument is too thoroughly carried out at all points and fortified
on all hands to require or even to admit of corroboration; and the attempt
to appropriate any share of the lasting credit which is his due would
be nothing less than a disingenuous impertinence.&nbsp; I may here however
notice that in the very first scene of this trilogy which introduces
us to the ever dear and honoured presence of Sir John, his creator has
put into the mouth of a witness no friendlier or more candid than Ned
Poins the distinction between two as true-bred cowards as ever turned
back and one who will fight no longer than he sees reason.&nbsp; In
this nutshell lies the whole kernel of the matter; the sweet, sound,
ripe, toothsome, wholesome kernel of Falstaff&rsquo;s character and
humour.&nbsp; He will fight as well as his princely patron, and, like
the prince, as long as he sees reason; but neither Hal nor Jack has
ever felt any touch of desire to pluck that &ldquo;mere scutcheon&rdquo;
honour &ldquo;from the pale-faced moon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Harry Percy is
as it were the true Sir Bedivere, the last of all Arthurian knights;
Henry V. is the first as certainly as he is the noblest of those equally
daring and calculating statesmen-warriors whose two most terrible, most
perfect, and most famous types are Louis XI. and C&aelig;sar Borgia.&nbsp;
Gain, &ldquo;commodity,&rdquo; the principle of self-interest which
never but in word and in jest could become the principle of action with
Faulconbridge,&mdash;himself already far more &ldquo;a man of this world&rdquo;
than a Launcelot or a Hotspur,&mdash;is as evidently the mainspring
of Henry&rsquo;s enterprise and life as of the contract between King
Philip and King John.&nbsp; The supple and shameless egotism of the
churchmen on whose political sophistries he relies for external support
is needed rather to varnish his project than to reassure his conscience.&nbsp;
Like Frederic the Great before his first Silesian war, the future conqueror
of Agincourt has practically made up his mind before he seeks to find
as good reason or as plausible excuse as were likewise to suffice the
future conqueror of Rosbach.&nbsp; In a word, Henry is doubtless not
the man, as old Auchindrane expresses it in the noble and strangely
neglected tragedy which bears solitary but sufficient witness to the
actual dramatic faculty of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s genius, to do the
devil&rsquo;s work without his wages; but neither is he, on the like
unprofitable terms, by any manner of means the man to do God&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
No completer incarnation could be shown us of the militant Englishman&mdash;<i>Anglais
pur sang</i>; but it is not only, as some have seemed to think, with
the highest, the purest, the noblest quality of English character that
his just and far-seeing creator has endowed him.&nbsp; The godlike equity
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s judgment, his implacable and impeccable righteousness
of instinct and of insight, was too deeply ingrained in the very core
of his genius to be perverted by any provincial or pseudo-patriotic
prepossessions; his patriotism was too national to be provincial.&nbsp;
Assuredly no poet ever had more than he: not even the king of men and
poets who fought at Marathon and sang of Salamis: much less had any
or has any one of our own, from Milton on to Campbell and from Campbell
even to Tennyson.&nbsp; In the mightiest chorus of <i>King Henry V</i>.
we hear the pealing ring of the same great English trumpet that was
yet to sound over the battle of the Baltic, and again in our later day
over a sea-fight of Shakespeare&rsquo;s own, more splendid and heart-cheering
in its calamity than that other and all others in their triumph; a war-song
and a sea-song divine and deep as death or as the sea, making thrice
more glorious at once the glorious three names of England, of Grenville,
and of Tennyson for ever.&nbsp; From the affectation of cosmopolitan
indifference not &AElig;schylus, not Pindar, not Dante&rsquo;s very
self was more alien or more free than Shakespeare; but there was nothing
of the dry Tyrt&aelig;an twang, the dull mechanic resonance as of wooden
echoes from a platform, in the great historic chord of his lyre.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is very English, too English, even,&rdquo; says the Master
on whom his enemies alone&mdash;assuredly not his most loving, most
reverent, and most thankful disciples&mdash;might possibly and plausibly
retort that he was &ldquo;very French, too French, even&rdquo;; but
he certainly was not &ldquo;too English&rdquo; to see and cleave to
the main fact, the radical and central truth, of personal or national
character, of typical history or tradition, without seeking to embellish,
to degrade, in either or in any way to falsify it.&nbsp; From king to
king, from cardinal to cardinal, from the earliest in date of subject
to the latest of his histories, we find the same thread running, the
same link of honourable and righteous judgment, of equitable and careful
equanimity, connecting and combining play with play in an unbroken and
infrangible chain of evidence to the singleness of the poet&rsquo;s
eye, the identity of the workman&rsquo;s hand, which could do justice
and would do no more than justice, alike to Henry and to Wolsey, to
Pandulph and to John.&nbsp; His typical English hero or historic protagonist
is a man of their type who founded and built up the empire of England
in India; a hero after the future pattern of Hastings and of Clive;
not less daringly sagacious and not more delicately scrupulous, not
less indomitable or more impeccable than they.&nbsp; A type by no means
immaculate, a creature not at all too bright and good for English nature&rsquo;s
daily food in times of mercantile or military enterprise; no whit more
if no whit less excellent and radiant than reality.&nbsp; <i>Amica Britannia,
sed magis amica veritas</i>.&nbsp; The master poet of England&mdash;all
Englishmen may reasonably and honourably be proud of it&mdash;has not
two weights and two measures for friend and foe.&nbsp; This palpable
and patent fact, as his only and worthy French translator has well remarked,
would of itself suffice to exonerate his memory from the imputation
of having perpetrated in its evil entirety <i>The First Part of King
Henry VI</i>.</p>
<p>There is, in my opinion, somewhat more of internal evidence than
I have ever seen adduced in support of the tradition current from an
early date as to the origin of the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>; a
tradition which assigns to Queen Elizabeth the same office of midwife
with regard to this comedy as was discharged by Elwood with reference
to <i>Paradise Regained</i>.&nbsp; Nothing could so naturally or satisfactorily
explain its existence as the expression of a desire to see &ldquo;Falstaff
in love,&rdquo; which must have been nothing less than the equivalent
of a command to produce him under the disguise of such a transfiguration
on the boards.&nbsp; The task of presenting him so shorn of his beams,
so much less than archangel (of comedy) ruined, and the excess of (humorous)
glory obscured, would hardly, we cannot but think and feel, have spontaneously
suggested itself to Shakespeare as a natural or eligible aim for the
fresh exercise of his comic genius.&nbsp; To exhibit Falstaff as throughout
the whole course of five acts a credulous and baffled dupe, one &ldquo;easier
to be played on than a pipe,&rdquo; was not really to reproduce him
at all.&nbsp; The genuine Falstaff could no more have played such a
part than the genuine Petruchio could have filled such an one as was
assigned him by Fletcher in the luckless hour when that misguided poet
undertook to continue the subject and to correct the moral of the next
comedy in our catalogue of Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; <i>The Tamer Tamed</i>
is hardly less consistent or acceptable as a sequel to the <i>Taming
of the Shrew</i> than the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i> as a supplement
to <i>King Henry IV</i>.: and no conceivable comparison could more forcibly
convey, how broad and deep is the gulf of incongruity which divides
them.</p>
<p>The plea for once suggested by the author in the way of excuse or
extenuation for this incompatibility of Falstaff with Falstaff&mdash;for
the violation of character goes far beyond mere inconsistency or the
natural ebb and flow of even the brightest wits and most vigorous intellects&mdash;will
commend itself more readily to the moralist than to the humanist; in
other words, to the preacher rather than to the thinker, the sophist
rather than the artist.&nbsp; Here only does Shakespeare show that he
feels the necessity of condescending to such evasion or such apology
as is implied in the explanation of Falstaff&rsquo;s incredible credulity
by a reference to &ldquo;the guiltiness of his mind&rdquo; and the admission,
so gratifying to all minds more moral than his own, that &ldquo;wit
may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when &rsquo;tis upon ill employment.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is the best excuse that can be made; but can we imagine the genuine,
the pristine Falstaff reduced to the proffer of such an excuse in serious
good earnest?</p>
<p>In the original version of this comedy there was not a note of poetry
from end to end; as it then appeared, it might be said to hold the same
place on the roll of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays as is occupied by <i>Bartholomew
Fair</i> on the roll of Ben Jonson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; From this point of
view it is curious to contrast the purely farcical masterpieces of the
town-bred schoolboy and the country lad.&nbsp; There is a certain faint
air of the fields, the river, and the park, even in the rough sketch
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s farce&mdash;wholly prosaic as it is, and in no
point suggestive of any unlikelihood in the report which represents
it as the composition or rather as the improvisation of a fortnight.&nbsp;
We know at once that he must have stroked the fallow greyhound that
was outrun on &ldquo;Cotsall&rdquo;; that he must&mdash;and perhaps
once or twice at least too often&mdash;have played truant (some readers,
boys past or present, might wish for association&rsquo;s sake it could
actually have been Datchet-wards) from under the shadow of good Sir
Hugh&rsquo;s probably not over formidable though &ldquo;threatening
twigs of birch,&rdquo; at all risks of being &ldquo;preeches&rdquo;
on his return, in fulfilment of the direful menace held out to that
young namesake of his over whose innocence Mrs. Quickly was so creditably
vigilant.&nbsp; On the other hand, no student of Jonson will need to
be reminded how closely and precociously familiar the big stalwart Westminster
boy, Camden&rsquo;s favoured and grateful pupil, must have made himself
with the rankest haunts and most unsavoury recesses of that ribald waterside
and Smithfield life which he lived to reproduce on the stage with a
sometimes insufferable fidelity to details from which Hogarth might
have shrunk.&nbsp; Even his unrivalled proficiency in classic learning
can hardly have been the fruit of greater or more willing diligence
in school hours than he must have lavished on other than scholastic
studies in the streets.&nbsp; The humour of his huge photographic group
of divers &ldquo;humours&rdquo; is undeniably and incomparably richer,
broader, fuller of invention and variety, than any that Shakespeare&rsquo;s
lighter work can show; all the five acts of the latter comedy can hardly
serve as counterpoise, in weight and wealth of comic effect, to the
single scene in which Zeal-of-the-Land defines the moral and theological
boundaries of action and intention which distinguish the innocent if
not laudable desire to eat pig from the venial though not mortal sin
of longing to eat pig in the thick of the profane Fair, which may rather
be termed a foul than a fair.&nbsp; Taken from that point of view which
looks only to force and freedom and range of humorous effect, Jonson&rsquo;s
play is to his friend&rsquo;s as London is to Windsor; but in more senses
than one it is to Shakespeare&rsquo;s as the Thames at London Bridge
is to the Thames at Eton: the atmosphere of Smithfield is not more different
from the atmosphere of the playing-fields; and some, too delicate of
nose or squeamish of stomach, may prefer Cuckoo Weir to Shoreditch.&nbsp;
But undoubtedly the phantoms of Shallow and Mrs. Quickly which put in
(so to speak) a nominal reappearance in the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>
are comparatively as poor and thin if set over against the full rich
outlines of Rabbi Busy and Dame Purecraft as these again are at all
points alike inferior to the real Shallow and the genuine Quickly of
<i>King Henry IV</i>.&nbsp; It is true that Jonson&rsquo;s humour has
sometimes less in common with Shakespeare&rsquo;s than with the humour
of Swift, Smollett, and Carlyle.&nbsp; For all his admiration and even
imitation of Rabelais, Shakespeare has hardly once or twice burnt but
so much as a stray pinch of fugitive incense on the altar of Cloacina;
the only Venus acknowledged and adored by those three latter humourists.&nbsp;
If not always constant with the constancy of Milton to the service of
Urania, he never turns into a dirtier byway or back alley than the beaten
path trodden occasionally by most of his kind which leads them on a
passing errand of no unnatural devotion to the shrine of Venus Pandemos.</p>
<p>When, however, we turn from the raw rough sketch to the enriched
and ennobled version of the present play we find it in this its better
shape more properly comparable with another and a nobler work of Jonson&rsquo;s&mdash;with
that magnificent comedy, the first avowed and included among his collection
by its author, which according to all tradition first owed its appearance
and success to the critical good sense and generous good offices of
Shakespeare.&nbsp; Neither my duly unqualified love for the greater
poet nor my duly qualified regard for the less can alter my sense that
their mutual relations are in this one case inverted; that <i>Every
Man in his Humour</i> is altogether a better comedy and a work of higher
art than the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>.&nbsp; Kitely is to Ford
almost what Arnolphe is to Sganarelle.&nbsp; (As according to the learned
M&eacute;taphraste &ldquo;Filio non potest pr&aelig;ferri nisi filius,&rdquo;
even so can no one but Moli&egrave;re be preferred or likened to Moli&egrave;re.)&nbsp;
Without actually touching like Arnolphe on the hidden springs of tragedy,
the jealous husband in Jonson&rsquo;s play is only kept from trenching
on the higher and forbidden grounds of passion by the potent will and
the consummate self-command of the great master who called him up in
perfect likeness to the life.&nbsp; Another or a deeper tone, another
or a stronger touch, in the last two admirable scenes with his cashier
and his wife, when his hot smouldering suspicion at length catches fire
and breaks out in agony of anger, would have removed him altogether
beyond the legitimate pale of comedy.&nbsp; As it is, the self-control
of the artist is as thorough as his grasp and mastery of his subject
are triumphant and complete.</p>
<p>It would seem as though on revision of the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>
Shakespeare had found himself unwilling or rather perhaps unable to
leave a single work of his hand without one touch or breath on it of
beauty or of poetry.&nbsp; The sole fitting element of harmonious relief
or variety in such a case could of course be found only in an interlude
of pure fancy; any touch of graver or deeper emotion would simply have
untuned and deranged the whole scheme of composition.&nbsp; A lesser
poet might have been powerless to resist the temptation or suggestion
of sentiment that he should give to the little loves of Anne Page and
Fenton a touch of pathetic or emotional interest; but &ldquo;opulent
as Shakespeare was, and of his opulence prodigal&rdquo; (to borrow a
phrase from Coleridge), he knew better than to patch with purple or
embroider with seed-pearl the hem of this homespun little piece of comic
drugget.&nbsp; The match between cloth of gold and cloth of frieze could
hardly have borne any good issue in this instance.&nbsp; Instead therefore
of following the lead of Terence&rsquo;s or the hint of Jonson&rsquo;s
example, and exalting the accent of his comedy to the full-mouthed pitch
of a Chremes or a Kitely, he strikes out some forty and odd lines of
rather coarse and commonplace doggrel about brokers, proctors, lousy
fox-eyed serjeants, blue and red noses, and so forth, to make room for
the bright light interlude of fairyland child&rsquo;s-play which might
not unfittingly have found place even within the moon-charmed circle
of <i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>.&nbsp; Even in that all heavenly
poem there are hardly to be found lines of more sweet and radiant simplicity
than here.</p>
<p>The refined instinct, artistic judgment, and consummate taste of
Shakespeare were perhaps never so wonderfully shown as in his recast
of another man&rsquo;s work&mdash;a man of real if rough genius for
comedy&mdash;which we get in the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>.&nbsp; Only
the collation of scene with scene, then of speech with speech, then
of line with line, will show how much may be borrowed from a stranger&rsquo;s
material and how much may be added to it by the same stroke of a single
hand.&nbsp; All the force and humour alike of character and situation
belong to Shakespeare&rsquo;s eclipsed and forlorn precursor; he has
added nothing; he has tempered and enriched everything.&nbsp; That the
luckless author of the first sketch is like to remain a man as nameless
as the deed of the witches in <i>Macbeth</i>, unless some chance or
caprice of accident should suddenly flash favouring light on his now
impersonal and indiscoverable individuality, seems clear enough when
we take into account the double and final disproof of his imaginary
identity with Marlowe, which Mr. Dyce has put forward with such unanswerable
certitude.&nbsp; He is a clumsy and coarse-fingered plagiarist from
that poet, and his stolen jewels of expression look so grossly out of
place in the homely setting of his usual style that they seem transmuted
from real to sham.&nbsp; On the other hand, he is of all the Pre-Shakespeareans
known to us incomparably the truest, the richest, the most powerful
and original humourist; one indeed without a second on that ground,
for &ldquo;the rest are nowhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now Marlowe, it need scarcely
be once again reiterated, was as certainly one of the least and worst
among jesters as he was one of the best and greatest among poets.&nbsp;
There can therefore be no serious question of his partnership in a play
wherein the comic achievement is excellent and the poetic attempts are
execrable throughout.</p>
<p>The recast of it in which a greater than Berni has deigned to play
the part of that poet towards a lesser than Bojardo shows tact and delicacy
perhaps without a parallel in literature.&nbsp; No chance of improvement
is missed, while nothing of value is dropped or thrown away. <a name="citation125"></a><a href="#footnote125">{125}</a>&nbsp;
There is just now and then a momentary return perceptible to the skipping
metre and fantastic manner of the first period, which may have been
unconsciously suggested by the nature of the task in hand&mdash;a task
of itself implying or suggesting some new study of old models; but the
main style of the play in all its weightier parts is as distinctly proper
to the second period, as clear an evidence of inner and spiritual affinity
(with actual tabulation of dates, were such a thing as feasible as it
is impossible, I must repeat that the argument would here be&mdash;what
it is now&mdash;in no wise concerned), as is the handling of character
throughout; but most especially the subtle force, the impeccable and
careful instinct, the masculine delicacy of touch, by which the somewhat
ruffianly temperament of the original Ferando is at once refined and
invigorated through its transmutation into the hearty and humorous manliness
of Petruchio&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It is observable that those few and faint traces which we have noticed
in this play of a faded archaic style trying as it were to resume a
mockery of revirescence are not wholly even if mainly confined to the
underplot which a suggestion or surmise of Mr. Collier&rsquo;s long
since assigned to Haughton, author of <i>Englishmen for my Money, or
A Woman will have her Will</i>: a spirited, vigorous, and remarkably
regular comedy of intrigue, full of rough and ready incident, bright
boisterous humour, honest lively provinciality and gay high-handed Philistinism.&nbsp;
To take no account of this attribution would be to show myself as shamelessly
as shamefully deficient in that respect and gratitude which all genuine
and thankful students will always be as ready to offer as all thankless
and insolent sciolists can ever be to disclaim, to the venerable scholar
who since I was first engaged on these notes has added yet another obligation
to the many under which he had already laid all younger and lesser labourers
in the same field of study, by the issue in a form fitly ennobled and
enriched of his great historical work on our early stage.&nbsp; It might
seem something of an unintended impertinence to add that such recognition
of his theory no more implies a blind acceptance of it&mdash;whatever
such acceptance on my part might be worth&mdash;than the expression
of such gratitude and respect could reasonably be supposed to imply
an equally blind confidence in the authority or the value of that version
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s text which has been the means of exposing a name
so long and so justly honoured, not merely to the natural and rational
inquisition of rival students, but to the rancorous and ribald obloquy
of thankless and frontless pretenders.</p>
<p>Here perhaps as well as anywhere else I may find a proper place to
intercalate the little word I have to say in partial redemption of my
pledge to take in due time some notice at more or less length, of the
only two among the plays doubtfully ascribed to Shakespeare which in
my eyes seem to bear any credible or conceivable traces of his touch.&nbsp;
Of these two I must give the lesser amount of space and attention to
that one which in itself is incomparably the more worthy of discussion,
admiration, and regard.&nbsp; The reason of this lies in the very excellence
which has attracted to it the notice of such competent judges and the
suffrage of such eminent names as would make the task of elaborate commentary
and analytic examination something more than superfluous on my part;
whereas the other has never been and will never be assigned to Shakespeare
by any critical student whose verdict is worth a minute&rsquo;s consideration
or the marketable value of a straw.&nbsp; Nevertheless it is on other
grounds worth notice; and such notice, to be itself of any value, must
of necessity be elaborate and minute.&nbsp; The critical analysis of
<i>King Edward III</i>. I have therefore relegated to its proper place
in an appendix; while I reserve a corner of my text, at once out of
admiration for the play itself and out of reverence for the names and
authority of some who have given their verdict in its behalf, for a
rough and rapid word or two on <i>Arden of Feversham</i>.</p>
<p>It is with equally inexpressible surprise that I find Mr. Collier
accepting as Shakespeare&rsquo;s any part of <i>A Warning for Fair Women</i>,
and rejecting without compromise or hesitation the belief or theory
which would assign to the youth of Shakespeare the incomparably nobler
tragic poem in question. <a name="citation129"></a><a href="#footnote129">{129}</a>&nbsp;
His first ascription to Shakespeare of <i>A Warning for Fair Women</i>
is couched in terms far more dubious and diffident than such as he afterwards
adopts.&nbsp; It &ldquo;might,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;be given to Shakespeare
on grounds far more plausible&rdquo; (on what, except possibly those
of date, I cannot imagine) &ldquo;than those applicable to <i>Arden
of Feversham</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then proceeds to cite some detached
lines and passages of undeniable beauty and vigour, containing equally
undeniable coincidences of language, illustration, and expression with
&ldquo;passages in Shakespeare&rsquo;s undisputed plays.&rdquo;&nbsp;
From these he passes on to indicate a &ldquo;resemblance&rdquo; which
&ldquo;is not merely verbal,&rdquo; and to extract whole speeches which
&ldquo;are Shakespearean in a much better sense&rdquo;; adding in a
surely too trenchant fashion, &ldquo;Here we say, <i>aut Shakespeare
aut diabolus</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I must confess, with all esteem for the
critic and all admiration for the brief scene cited, that I cannot say,
Shakespeare.</p>
<p>There are spirits of another sort from whom we naturally expect such
assumptions and inferences as start from the vantage ground of a few
separate or separable passages, and clear at a flying leap the empty
space intervening which divides them from the goal of evidence as to
authorship.&nbsp; Such a spirit was that of the late Mr. Simpson, to
whose wealth of misused learning and fertility of misapplied conjecture
I have already paid all due tribute; but who must have had beyond all
other sane men&mdash;most assuredly, beyond all other fairly competent
critics&mdash;the gift bestowed on him by a malignant fairy of mistaking
assumption for argument and possibility for proof.&nbsp; He was the
very Columbus of mare&rsquo;s nests; to the discovery of them, though
they lay far beyond the pillars of Hercules, he would apply all shifts
and all resources possible to an ultra-Baconian process of unphilosophical
induction.&nbsp; On the devoted head of Shakespeare&mdash;who is also
called Shakspere and Chaxpur&mdash;he would have piled a load of rubbish,
among which the crude and vigorous old tragedy under discussion shines
out like a veritable diamond of the desert.&nbsp; His &ldquo;School
of Shakspere,&rdquo; though not an academy to be often of necessity
perambulated by the most peripatetic student of Shakespeare, will remain
as a monument of critical or uncritical industry, a storehouse of curious
if not of precious relics, and a warning for other than fair women&mdash;or
fair scholars&mdash;to remember where &ldquo;it is written that the
shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last,
the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To me the difference appears immeasurable between the reasons for
admitting the possibility of Shakespeare&rsquo;s authorship in the case
of <i>Arden of Feversham</i>, and the pretexts for imagining the probability
of his partnership in <i>A Warning for Fair Women</i>.&nbsp; There is
a practically infinite distinction between the evidence suggested by
verbal or even more than verbal resemblance of detached line to line
or selected passage to passage, and the proof supplied by the general
harmony and spiritual similarity of a whole poem, on comparison of it
as a whole with the known works of the hypothetical author.&nbsp; This
proof, at all events, we surely do not get from consideration in this
light of the plea put forward in behalf of <i>A Warning for Fair Women</i>.&nbsp;
This proof, I cannot but think, we are very much nearer getting from
contemplation under the same light of the claim producible for <i>Arden
of Feversham</i>.</p>
<p><i>A Warning for Fair Women</i> is unquestionably in its way a noticeable
and valuable &ldquo;piece of work,&rdquo; as Sly might have defined
it.&nbsp; It is perhaps the best example anywhere extant of a merely
realistic tragedy&mdash;of realism pure and simple applied to the service
of the highest of the arts.&nbsp; Very rarely does it rise for a very
brief interval to the height of tragic or poetic style, however simple
and homely.&nbsp; The epilogue affixed to <i>Arden of Feversham</i>
asks pardon of the &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; composing its audience for
&ldquo;this naked tragedy,&rdquo; on the plea that &ldquo;simple truth
is gracious enough&rdquo; without needless ornament or bedizenment of
&ldquo;glozing stuff.&rdquo;&nbsp; Far more appropriate would such an
apology have been as in this case was at least superfluous, if appended
by way of epilogue to <i>A Warning for Fair Women</i>.&nbsp; That is
indeed a naked tragedy; nine-tenths of it are in no wise beyond the
reach of an able, industrious, and practised reporter, commissioned
by the proprietors of the journal on whose staff he might be engaged
to throw into the force of scenic dialogue his transcript of the evidence
in a popular and exciting case of adultery and murder.&nbsp; The one
figure on the stage of this author which stands out sharply defined
in our recollection against a background of undistinguished shadows
is the figure of the adulterer and murderer.&nbsp; This most discreditable
of Browns has a distinct and brawny outline of his own, a gait and accent
as of a genuine and recognisable man, who might have put to some better
profit his shifty spirit of enterprise, his genuine capacity of affection,
his burly ingenuity and hardihood.&nbsp; His minor confidants and accomplices,
Mrs. Drury and her Trusty Roger, are mere commonplace profiles of malefactors:
but it is in the contrast between the portraits of their two criminal
heroines that the vast gulf of difference between the capacities of
the two poets yawns patent to the sense of all readers.&nbsp; Anne Sanders
and Alice Arden stand as far beyond comparison apart as might a portrait
by any average academician and a portrait by Watts or Millais.&nbsp;
Once only, in the simple and noble scene cited by the over-generous
partiality of Mr. Collier, does the widow and murderess of Sanders rise
to the tragic height of the situation and the dramatic level of the
part so unfalteringly sustained from first to last by the wife and the
murderess of Arden.</p>
<p>There is the self-same relative difference between the two subordinate
groups of innocent or guilty characters.&nbsp; That is an excellent
and effective touch of realism, where Brown comes across his victim&rsquo;s
little boy playing truant in the street with a small schoolfellow; but
in <i>Arden of Feversham</i> the number of touches as telling and as
striking as this one is practically numberless.&nbsp; They also show
a far stronger and keener faculty of poetic if not of dramatic imagination.&nbsp;
The casual encounter of little Sanders with the yet red-handed murderer
of his father is not comparable for depth and subtlety of effect with
the scene in which Arden&rsquo;s friend Franklin, riding with him to
Raynham Down, breaks off his &ldquo;pretty tale&rdquo; of a perjured
wife, overpowered by a &ldquo;fighting at his heart,&rdquo; at the moment
when they come close upon the ambushed assassins in Alice Arden&rsquo;s
pay.&nbsp; But the internal evidence in this case, as I have already
intimated, does not hinge upon the proof or the suggestion offered by
any single passage or by any number of single passages.&nbsp; The first
and last evidence of real and demonstrable weight is the evidence of
character.&nbsp; A good deal might be said on the score of style in
favour of its attribution to a poet of the first order, writing at a
time when there were but two such poets writing for the stage; but even
this is here a point of merely secondary importance.&nbsp; It need only
be noted in passing that if the problem be reduced to a question between
the authorship of Shakespeare and the authorship of Marlowe there is
no need and no room for further argument.&nbsp; The whole style of treatment
from end to end is about as like the method of Marlowe as the method
of Balzac is like the method of Dumas.&nbsp; There could be no alternative
in that case; so that the actual alternative before us is simple enough:
Either this play is the young Shakespeare&rsquo;s first tragic masterpiece,
or there was a writer unknown to us then alive and at work for the stage
who excelled him as a tragic dramatist not less&mdash;to say the very
least&mdash;than he was excelled by Marlowe as a narrative and tragic
poet.</p>
<p>If we accept, as I have been told that Goethe accepted (a point which
I regret my inability to verify), the former of these alternatives&mdash;or
if at least we assume it for argument&rsquo;s sake in passing&mdash;we
may easily strengthen our position by adducing as further evidence in
its favour the author&rsquo;s thoroughly Shakespearean fidelity to the
details of the prose narrative on which his tragedy is founded.&nbsp;
But, it may be objected, we find the same fidelity to a similar text
in the case of <i>A Warning for Fair Women</i>.&nbsp; And here again
starts up the primal and radical difference between the two works: it
starts up and will not be overlooked.&nbsp; Equal fidelity to the narrative
text we do undoubtedly find in either case; the same fidelity we assuredly
do not find.&nbsp; The one is a typical example of prosaic realism,
the other of poetic reality.&nbsp; Light from darkness or truth from
falsehood is not more infallibly discernible.&nbsp; The fidelity in
the one case is exactly, as I have already indicated, the fidelity of
a reporter to his notes.&nbsp; The fidelity in the other case is exactly
the fidelity of Shakespeare in his Roman plays to the text of Plutarch.&nbsp;
It is a fidelity which admits&mdash;I had almost written, which requires&mdash;the
fullest play of the highest imagination.&nbsp; No more than the most
realistic of reporters will it omit or falsify any necessary or even
admissible detail; but the indefinable quality which it adds to the
lowest as to the highest of these is (as Lamb says of passion) &ldquo;the
all in all in poetry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Turning again for illustration to
one of the highest names in imaginative literature&mdash;a name sometimes
most improperly and absurdly inscribed on the register of the realistic
school, <a name="citation137"></a><a href="#footnote137">{137}</a> we
may say that the difference on this point is not the difference between
Balzac and Dumas, but the distinction between Balzac and M. Zola.&nbsp;
Let us take by way of example the character next in importance to that
of the heroine&mdash;the character of her paramour.&nbsp; A viler figure
was never sketched by Balzac; a viler figure was seldom drawn by Thackeray.&nbsp;
But as with Balzac, so with the author of this play, the masterful will
combining with the masterly art of the creator who fashions out of the
worst kind of human clay the breathing likeness of a creature so hatefully
pitiful and so pitifully hateful overcomes, absorbs, annihilates all
sense of such abhorrence and repulsion as would prove the work which
excited them no high or even true work of art.&nbsp; Even the wonderful
touch of dastardly brutality and pitiful self-pity with which Mosbie
at once receives and repels the condolence of his mistress on his wound&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Alice</i>.&mdash;Sweet Mosbie, hide thine arm, it
kills my heart.</p>
<p><i>Mosbie</i>.&mdash;<i>Ay, Mistress Arden, this is your favour</i>.&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>even this does not make unendurable the scenic representation of
what in actual life would be unendurable for any man to witness.&nbsp;
Such an exhibition of currish cowardice and sullen bullying spite increases
rather our wondering pity for its victim than our wondering sense of
her degradation.&nbsp; And this is a kind of triumph which only such
an artist as Shakespeare in poetry or as Balzac in prose can achieve.</p>
<p>Alice Arden, if she be indeed a daughter of Shakespeare&rsquo;s,
is the eldest born of that group to which Lady Macbeth and Dionyza belong
by right of weird sisterhood.&nbsp; The wives of the thane of Glamis
and the governor of Tharsus, it need hardly be said, are both of them
creations of a much later date&mdash;if not of the very latest discernible
or definable stage in the art of Shakespeare.&nbsp; Deeply dyed as she
is in bloodguiltiness, the wife of Arden is much less of a born criminal
than these.&nbsp; To her, at once the agent and the patient of her crime,
the victim and the instrument of sacrifice and blood-offering to Venus
Libitina, goddess of love and death,&mdash;to her, even in the deepest
pit of her deliberate wickedness, remorse is natural and redemption
conceivable.&nbsp; Like the Ph&aelig;dra of Racine, and herein so nobly
unlike the Ph&aelig;dra of Euripides, she is capable of the deepest
and bitterest penitence,&mdash;incapable of dying with a hideous and
homicidal falsehood on her long polluted lips.&nbsp; Her latest breath
is not a lie but a prayer.</p>
<p>Considering, then, in conclusion, the various and marvellous gifts
displayed for the first time on our stage by the great poet, the great
dramatist, the strong and subtle searcher of hearts, the just and merciful
judge and painter of human passions, who gave this tragedy to the new-born
literature of our drama; taking into account the really wonderful skill,
the absoluteness of intuition and inspiration, with which every stroke
is put in that touches off character or tones down effect, even in the
sketching and grouping of such minor figures as the ruffianly hireling
Black Will, the passionate artist without pity or conscience, <a name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141">{141}</a>
and above all the &ldquo;unimitated, inimitable&rdquo; study of Michael,
in whom even physical fear becomes tragic, and cowardice itself no ludicrous
infirmity but rather a terrible passion; I cannot but finally take heart
to say, even in the absence of all external or traditional testimony,
that it seems to me not pardonable merely nor permissible, but simply
logical and reasonable, to set down this poem, a young man&rsquo;s work
on the face of it, as the possible work of no man&rsquo;s youthful hand
but Shakespeare&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>No similar question is raised, no parallel problem stated, in the
case of any one other among the plays now or ever ascribed on grounds
more or less dubious to that same indubitable hand.&nbsp; This hand
I do not recognise even in the <i>Yorkshire Tragedy</i>, full as it
is to overflowing of fierce animal power, and hot as with the furious
breath of some caged wild beast.&nbsp; Heywood, who as the most realistic
and in some sense prosaic dramatist of his time has been credited (though
but in a modestly tentative and suggestive fashion) with its authorship,
was as incapable of writing it as Chapman of writing the Shakespearean
parts of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i> or Fletcher of writing the scenes
of Wolsey&rsquo;s fall and Katherine&rsquo;s death in <i>King Henry
VIII</i>.&nbsp; To the only editor of Shakespeare responsible for the
two earlier of the three suggestions here set aside, they may be forgiven
on the score of insufficient scholarship and want of critical training;
but on what ground the third suggestion can be excused in the case of
men who should have a better right than most others to speak with some
show of authority on a point of higher criticism, I must confess myself
utterly at a loss to imagine.&nbsp; In the <i>Yorkshire Tragedy</i>
the submissive devotion of its miserable heroine to her maddened husband
is merely doglike,&mdash;though not even, in the exquisitely true and
tender phrase of our sovereign poetess, &ldquo;most passionately patient.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There is no likeness in this poor trampled figure to &ldquo;one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
women&rdquo;: Griselda was no ideal of his.&nbsp; To find its parallel
in the dramatic literature of the great age, we must look to lesser
great men than Shakespeare.&nbsp; Ben Jonson, a too exclusively masculine
poet, will give us a couple of companion figures for her&mdash;or one
such figure at least; for the wife of Fitzdottrel, submissive as she
is even to the verge of undignified if not indecorous absurdity, is
less of a human spaniel than the wife of Corvino.&nbsp; Another such
is Robert Davenport&rsquo;s Abstemia, so warmly admired by Washington
Irving; another is the heroine of that singularly powerful and humorous
tragi-comedy, labelled to <i>How to Choose a Good Wife from a Bad</i>,
which in its central situation anticipates that of Leigh Hunt&rsquo;s
beautiful <i>Legend of Florence</i>; while Decker has revived, in one
of our sweetest and most graceful examples of dramatic romance, the
original incarnation of that somewhat pitiful ideal which even in a
ruder and more Russian century of painful European progress out of night
and winter could only be made credible, acceptable, or endurable, by
the yet unequalled genius of Chaucer and Boccaccio.</p>
<p>For concentrated might and overwhelming weight of realism, this lurid
little play beats <i>A Warning for Fair Women</i> fairly out of the
field.&nbsp; It is and must always be (I had nearly said, thank heaven)
unsurpassable for pure potency of horror; and the breathless heat of
the action, its raging rate of speed, leaves actually no breathing-time
for disgust; it consumes our very sense of repulsion as with fire.&nbsp;
But such power as this, though a rare and a great gift, is not the right
quality for a dramatist; it is not the fit property of a poet.&nbsp;
Ford and Webster, even Tourneur and Marston, who have all been more
or less wrongfully though more or less plausibly attacked on the score
of excess in horror, have none of them left us anything so nakedly terrible,
so terribly naked as this.&nbsp; Passion is here not merely stripped
to the skin but stripped to the bones.&nbsp; I cannot tell who could
and I cannot guess who would have written it.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
a very excellent piece of work&rdquo;; may we never exactly look upon
its like again!</p>
<p>I thought it at one time far from impossible, if not very nearly
probable, that the author of <i>Arden of Feversham</i> might be one
with the author of the famous additional scenes to <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>,
and that either both of these &ldquo;pieces of work&rdquo; or neither
must be Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I still adhere to Coleridge&rsquo;s
verdict, which indeed must be that of all judges capable of passing
any sentence worthier of record than are</p>
<blockquote><p>Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle<br />
For girls of nine:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to the effect that those magnificent passages, wellnigh overcharged
at every point with passion and subtlety, sincerity and instinct of
pathetic truth, are no less like Shakespeare&rsquo;s work than unlike
Jonson&rsquo;s: though hardly perhaps more unlike the typical manner
of his adult and matured style than is the general tone of <i>The Case
is Altered</i>, his one surviving comedy of that earlier period in which
we know from Henslowe that the stout-hearted and long struggling young
playwright went through so much theatrical hackwork and piecework in
the same rough harness with other now more or less notable workmen then
drudging under the manager&rsquo;s dull narrow sidelong eye for bare
bread and bare shelter.&nbsp; But this unlikeness, great as it is and
serious and singular, between his former and his latter style in high
comedy, gives no warrant for us to believe him capable of so immeasurable
a transformation in tragic style and so indescribable a decadence in
tragic power as would be implied in a descent from the &ldquo;fine madness&rdquo;
of &ldquo;old Jeronymo&rdquo; to the flat sanity and smoke-dried sobriety
of <i>Catiline</i> and <i>Sejanus</i>.&mdash;I cannot but think, too,
that Lamb&rsquo;s first hypothetical ascription of these wonderful scenes
to Webster, so much the most Shakespearean in gait and port and accent
of all Shakespeare&rsquo;s liege men-at-arms, was due to a far happier
and more trustworthy instinct than led him in later years to liken them
rather to &ldquo;the overflowing griefs and talking distraction of Titus
Andronicus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have wandered it may be somewhat out of the right time into a
far other province of poetry than the golden land of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
ripest harvest-fields of humour.&nbsp; And now, before we may enter
the &ldquo;flowery square&rdquo; made by the summer growth of his four
greatest works in pure and perfect comedy &ldquo;beneath a broad and
equal-blowing wind&rdquo; of all happiest and most fragrant imagination,
we have but one field to cross, one brook to ford, that hardly can be
thought to keep us out of Paradise.&nbsp; In the garden-plot on whose
wicket is inscribed <i>All&rsquo;s Well that Ends Well</i>, we are hardly
distant from Eden itself</p>
<blockquote><p>About a young dove&rsquo;s flutter from a wood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ninth story of the third day of the Decameron is one of the few
subjects chosen by Shakespeare&mdash;as so many were taken by Fletcher&mdash;which
are less fit, we may venture to think, for dramatic than for narrative
treatment.&nbsp; He has here again shown all possible delicacy of instinct
in handling a matter which unluckily it was not possible to handle on
the stage with absolute and positive delicacy of feeling or expression.&nbsp;
Dr. Johnson&mdash;in my humble opinion, with some justice; though his
verdict has been disputed on the score of undeserved austerity&mdash;&ldquo;could
not reconcile his heart to Bertram&rdquo;; and I, unworthy as I may
be to second or support on the score of morality the finding of so great
a moralist, cannot reconcile my instincts to Helena.&nbsp; Parolles
is even better than Bobadil, as Bobadil is even better than Bessus;
and Lafeu is one of the very best old men in all the range of comic
art.&nbsp; But the whole charm and beauty of the play, the quality which
raises it to the rank of its fellows by making it loveable as well as
admirable, we find only in the &ldquo;sweet, serene, skylike&rdquo;
sanctity and attraction of adorable old age, made more than ever near
and dear to us in the incomparable figure of the old Countess of Roussillon.&nbsp;
At the close of the play, Fletcher would inevitably have married her
to Lafeu&mdash;or rather possibly, to the King.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the heavenly quadrilateral, or under the rising
dawn of the four fixed stars which compose our Northern Cross among
the constellations of dramatic romance hung high in the highest air
of poetry, we may well pause for very dread of our own delight, lest
unawares we break into mere babble of childish rapture and infantile
thanksgiving for such light vouchsafed even to our &ldquo;settentrional
vedovo sito&rdquo; that even at their first dawn out of the depths</p>
<blockquote><p>Goder pareva il ciel di lor fiammelle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond these again we see a second group arising, the supreme starry
trinity of the <i>Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i>, the <i>Tempest</i>, and <i>Cymbeline</i>:
and beyond these the divine darkness of everlasting and all-maternal
night.&nbsp; These seven lamps of the romantic drama have in them&mdash;if
I may strain the similitude a little further yet&mdash;more of lyric
light than could fitly be lent to feed the fire or the sunshine of the
worlds of pure tragedy or comedy.&nbsp; There is more play, more vibration
as it were, in the splendours of their spheres.&nbsp; Only in the heaven
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s making can we pass and repass at pleasure from
the sunny to the stormy lights, from the glory of <i>Cymbeline</i> to
the glory of <i>Othello</i>.</p>
<p>In this first group of four&mdash;wholly differing on that point
from the later constellation of three&mdash;there is but very seldom,
not more than once or twice at most, a shooting or passing gleam of
anything more lurid or less lovely than &ldquo;a light of laughing flowers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There is but just enough of evil or even of passion admitted into their
sweet spheres of life to proclaim them living: and all that does find
entrance is so tempered by the radiance of the rest that we retain but
softened and lightened recollections even of Shylock and Don John when
we think of the <i>Merchant of Venice</i> and <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>;
we hardly feel in <i>As You Like It</i> the presence or the existence
of Oliver and Duke Frederick; and in <i>Twelfth Night</i>, for all its
name of the midwinter, we find nothing to remember that might jar with
the loveliness of love and the summer light of life.</p>
<p>No astronomer can ever tell which if any one among these four may
be to the others as a sun; for in this special tract of heaven &ldquo;one
star differeth&rdquo; not &ldquo;from another star in glory.&rdquo;&nbsp;
From each and all of them, even &ldquo;while this muddy vesture of decay
doth grossly close [us] in,&rdquo; we cannot <i>but</i> hear the harmony
of a single immortal soul</p>
<blockquote><p>Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The coincidence of the divine passage in which I have for once permitted
myself the freedom of altering for quotation&rsquo;s sake one little
word, with a noble excerpt given by Hallam from the Latin prose writings
of Campanella, may recall to us with a doubly appropriate sense of harmonious
fitness the subtly beautiful image of Lord Tennyson;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Star to star vibrates light: may soul to soul<br />
Strike thro&rsquo; a finer element of her own?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely, if ever she may, such a clash might we fancy to have passed
from the spirit of the most glorious martyr and poet to the spirit of
the most glorious poet and artist upon the face of the earth together.&nbsp;
Even to Shakespeare any association of his name with Campanella&rsquo;s,
as even to Campanella any association of his name with Shakespeare&rsquo;s,
cannot but be an additional ray of honour: and how high is the claim
of the divine philosopher to share with the godlike dramatist their
common and crowning name of poet, all Englishmen at least may now perceive
by study of Campanella&rsquo;s sonnets in the noble and exquisite version
of Mr. Symonds; to whom among other kindred debts we owe no higher obligation
than is due to him as the giver of these poems to the inmost heart of
all among his countrymen whose hearts are worthy to hold and to hoard
up such treasure.</p>
<p>Where nothing at once new and true can be said, it is always best
to say nothing; as it is in this case to refrain from all reiteration
of rhapsody which must have been somewhat &ldquo;mouldy ere&rdquo; any
living man&rsquo;s &ldquo;grandsires had nails on their toes,&rdquo;
if not at that yet remoter date &ldquo;when King Pepin of France was
a little boy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Queen Guinever of Britain was a little
wench.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, at all events,
there is hardly a single character from Portia to old Gobbo, a single
incident from the exaction of Shylock&rsquo;s bond to the computation
of hairs in Launcelot&rsquo;s beard and Dobbin&rsquo;s tail, which has
not been more plentifully beprosed than ever Rosalind was berhymed.&nbsp;
Much wordy wind has also been wasted on comparison of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Jew with Marlowe&rsquo;s; that is, of a living subject for terror and
pity with a mere mouthpiece for the utterance of poetry as magnificent
as any but the best of Shakespeare&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Nor can it well be worth any man&rsquo;s while to say or to hear
for the thousandth time that <i>As You Like It</i> would be one of those
works which prove, as Landor said long since, the falsehood of the stale
axiom that no work of man&rsquo;s can be perfect, were it not for that
one unlucky slip of the brush which has left so ugly a little smear
in one corner of the canvas as the betrothal of Oliver to Celia; though,
with all reverence for a great name and a noble memory, I can hardly
think that matters were much mended in George Sand&rsquo;s adaptation
of the play by the transference of her hand to Jaques.&nbsp; Once elsewhere,
or twice only at the most, is any such other sacrifice of moral beauty
or spiritual harmony to the necessities and traditions of the stage
discernible in all the world-wide work of Shakespeare.&nbsp; In the
one case it is unhappily undeniable; no mans conscience, no conceivable
sense of right and wrong, but must more or less feel as did Coleridge&rsquo;s
the double violence done it in the upshot of <i>Measure for Measure</i>.&nbsp;
Even in the much more nearly spotless work which we have next to glance
at, some readers have perhaps not unreasonably found a similar objection
to the final good fortune of such a pitiful fellow as Count Claudio.&nbsp;
It will be observed that in each case the sacrifice is made to comedy.&nbsp;
The actual or hypothetical necessity of pairing off all the couples
after such a fashion as to secure a nominally happy and undeniably matrimonial
ending is the theatrical idol whose tyranny exacts this holocaust of
higher and better feelings than the mere liquorish desire to leave the
board of fancy with a palatable morsel of cheap sugar on the tongue.</p>
<p>If it is proverbially impossible to determine by selection the greatest
work of Shakespeare, it is easy enough to decide on the date and the
name of his most perfect comic masterpiece.&nbsp; For absolute power
of composition, for faultless balance and blameless rectitude of design,
there is unquestionably no creation of his hand that will bear comparison
with <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>.&nbsp; The ultimate marriage of Hero
and Claudio, on which I have already remarked as in itself a doubtfully
desirable consummation, makes no flaw in the dramatic perfection of
a piece which could not otherwise have been wound up at all.&nbsp; This
was its one inevitable conclusion, if the action were not to come to
a tragic end; and a tragic end would here have been as painfully and
as grossly out of place as is any but a tragic end to the action of
<i>Measure for Measure</i>.&nbsp; As for Beatrice, she is as perfect
a lady, though of a far different age and breeding, as C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne
or Millamant; and a decidedly more perfect woman than could properly
or permissibly have trod the stage of Congreve or Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp;
She would have disarranged all the dramatic proprieties and harmonies
of the one great school of pure comedy.&nbsp; The good fierce outbreak
of her high true heart in two swift words&mdash;&ldquo;Kill Claudio&rdquo;
<a name="citation154"></a><a href="#footnote154">{154}</a>&mdash;would
have fluttered the dovecotes of fashionable drama to some purpose.&nbsp;
But Alceste would have taken her to his own.</p>
<p>No quainter and apter example was ever given of many men&rsquo;s
absolute inability to see the plainest aims, to learn the simplest rudiments,
to appreciate the most practical requisites of art, whether applied
to theatrical action or to any other as evident as exalted aim, than
the instance afforded by that criticism of time past which sagaciously
remarked that &ldquo;any less amusingly absurd&rdquo; constables than
Dogberry and Verges would have filled their parts in the action of the
play equally well.&nbsp; Our own day has doubtless brought forth critics
and students of else unparalleled capacity for the task of laying wind-eggs
in mare&rsquo;s nests, and wasting all the warmth of their brains and
tongues in the hopeful endeavour to hatch them: but so fine a specimen
was never dropped yet as this of the plumed or plumeless biped who discovered
that if Dogberry had not been Dogberry and Verges had not been Verges
they would have been equally unsuccessful in their honest attempt to
warn Leonato betimes of the plot against his daughter&rsquo;s honour.&nbsp;
The only explanation of the mistake is this; and it is one of which
the force will be intelligible only to those who are acquainted with
the very singular physiology of that remarkably prolific animal known
to critical science as the Shakespearean scholiast: that if Dogberry
had been other than Dogberry, or if Verges had been other than Verges,
the action and catastrophe of the whole play could never have taken
place at all.</p>
<p>All true Pantagruelians will always, or at least as long as may be
permitted by the Society for the Suppression of Vice, cherish with an
especial regard the comedy in which Shakespeare also has shown himself
as surely the loving as he would surely have been the beloved disciple
of that insuppressible divine, the immortal and most reverend vicar
of Meudon.&nbsp; Two only among the mighty men who lived and wrote and
died within the century which gave birth to Shakespeare were found worthy
of so great an honour at his hands as the double homage of citation
and imitation: and these two, naturally and properly enough, were Fran&ccedil;ois
Rabelais and Christopher Marlowe.&nbsp; We cannot but recognise on what
far travels in what good company &ldquo;Feste the jester&rdquo; had
but lately been, on that night of &ldquo;very gracious fooling&rdquo;
when he was pleased to enlighten the unforgetful mind of Sir Andrew
as to the history of Pigrogromitus, and of the Vapians passing the equinoctial
of Queubus.&nbsp; At what precise degree of latitude and longitude between
the blessed islands of Medamothy and Papimania this equinoctial may
intersect the Sporades of the outer ocean, is a problem on the solution
of which the energy of those many modern sons of Aguecheek who have
undertaken the task of writing about and about the text and the history
of Shakespeare might be expended with an unusually reasonable hope and
expectation of arriving at an exceptionally profitable end.</p>
<p>Even apart from their sunny identity of spirit and bright sweet brotherhood
of style, the two comedies of <i>Twelfth Night</i> and <i>As You Like
It</i> would stand forth confessed as the common offspring of the same
spiritual period by force and by right of the trace or badge they proudly
and professedly bear in common, as of a recent touch from the ripe and
rich and radiant influence of Rabelais.&nbsp; No better and no fuller
vindication of his happy memory could be afforded than by the evident
fact that the two comedies which bear the imprint of his sign-manual
are among all Shakespeare&rsquo;s works as signally remarkable for the
cleanliness as for the richness of their humour.&nbsp; Here is the right
royal seal of Pantagruel, clean-cut and clearly stamped, and unincrusted
with any flake of dirt from the dubious finger of Panurge.&nbsp; In
the comic parts of those plays in which the humour is rank and flagrant
that exhales from the lips of Lucio, of Boult, or of Thersites, there
is no trace or glimpse of Rabelais.&nbsp; From him Shakespeare has learnt
nothing and borrowed nothing that was not wise and good and sweet and
clean and pure.&nbsp; All the more honour, undoubtedly, to Shakespeare,
that he would borrow nothing else: but assuredly, also, all the more
honour to Rabelais, that he had enough of this to lend.</p>
<p>It is less creditable to England than honourable to France that a
Frenchman should have been the first of Shakespearean students to discover
and to prove that the great triad of his Roman plays is not a consecutive
work of the same epoch.&nbsp; Until the appearance of Fran&ccedil;ois-Victor
Hugo&rsquo;s incomparable translation, with its elaborate and admirable
commentary, it seems to have been the universal and certainly a most
natural habit of English criticism to take the three as they usually
appear together, in the order of historical chronology, and by tacit
implication to assume that they were composed in such order.&nbsp; I
should take some shame to myself but that I feel more of grateful pride
than of natural shame in the avowal that I at all events owe the first
revelation of the truth now so clear and apparent in this matter, to
the son of the common lord and master of all poets born in his age&mdash;be
they liege subjects as loyal as myself or as contumacious as I grieve
to find one at least of my elders and betters, whenever I perceive&mdash;as
too often I cannot choose but perceive&mdash;that the voice is the voice
of Arnold, but the hand is the hand of Sainte-Beuve.</p>
<p>To the honoured and lamented son of our beloved and glorious Master,
whom neither I nor any better man can ever praise and thank and glorify
enough, belongs all the credit of discerning for himself and discovering
for us all the truth that <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> is at all points
equally like the greatest works of Shakespeare&rsquo;s middle period
and unlike the works of his last.&nbsp; It is in the main a play belonging
to the same order as <i>King Henry IV</i>.; but it differs from our
English Henriade&mdash;as remarkably unlike Voltaire&rsquo;s as <i>Za&iuml;re</i>
is unlike <i>Othello</i>&mdash;not more by the absence of Falstaff than
by the presence of Brutus.&nbsp; Here at least Shakespeare has made
full amends, if not to all modern democrats, yet assuredly to all historical
republicans, for any possible or apparent preference of royal to popular
traditions.&nbsp; Whatever manner of man may have been the actual Roman,
our Shakespearean Brutus is undoubtedly the very noblest figure of a
typical and ideal republican in all the literature of the world.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A democracy such as yours in America is my abhorrence,&rdquo;
wrote Landor once to an impudent and foul-mouthed Yankee pseudosopher,
who had intruded himself on that great man&rsquo;s privacy in order
to have the privilege of afterwards informing the readers of a pitiful
pamphlet on England that Landor had &ldquo;pestered him with Southey&rdquo;;
an impertinence, I may add, which Mr. Landor at once rebuked with the
sharpest contempt and chastised with the haughtiest courtesy.&nbsp;
But, the old friend and lifelong champion of Kossuth went on to say,
his feelings were far different towards a republic; and if on the one
point, then not less certainly on the other, we may be assured that
his convictions and his prepossessions would have been shared by the
author of <i>Coriolanus</i> and <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>.</p>
<p>Having now come perforce to the inevitable verge of <i>Hamlet</i>,
I hasten to declare that I can advance no pretension to compete with
the claim of that &ldquo;literary man&rdquo; who became immortal by
dint of one dinner with a bishop, and in right of that last glass poured
out for him in sign of amity by &ldquo;Sylvester Blougram, styled <i>in
partibus Episcopus</i>, <i>necnon</i> the deuce knows what.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I do not propose to prove my perception of any point in the character
of Hamlet &ldquo;unseized by the Germans yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; I can only
determine, as the Church Catechism was long since wont to bid me, &ldquo;to
keep my hands from picking and stealing, and my tongue&rdquo; not only
&ldquo;from evil-speaking, lying, and slandering&rdquo;&mdash;though
this itself is a form of abstinence not universally or even commonly
practised among the rampant rout of rival commentators&mdash;but also,
now as ever throughout this study, from all conscious repetition of
what others have said before me.</p>
<p>In <i>Hamlet</i>, as it seems to me, we set foot as it were on the
bridge between the middle and the final period of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
That priceless waif of piratical salvage which we owe to the happy rapacity
of a hungry publisher is of course more accurately definable as the
first play of <i>Hamlet</i> than as the first edition of the play.&nbsp;
And this first <i>Hamlet</i>, on the whole, belongs altogether to the
middle period.&nbsp; The deeper complexities of the subject are merely
indicated.&nbsp; Simple and trenchant outlines of character are yet
to be supplanted by features of subtler suggestion and infinite interfusion.&nbsp;
Hamlet himself is almost more of a satirist than a philosopher: Asper
and Macilente, Felice and Malevole, the grim studies after Hamlet unconsciously
or consciously taken by Jonson and Marston, may pass as wellnigh passable
imitations, with an inevitable streak of caricature in them, of the
first Hamlet; they would have been at once puerile and ghastly travesties
of the second.&nbsp; The Queen, whose finished figure is now something
of a riddle, stands out simply enough in the first sketch as confidant
of Horatio if not as accomplice of Hamlet.&nbsp; There is not more difference
between the sweet quiet flow of those plain verses which open the original
play within the play and the stiff sonorous tramp of their substitutes,
full-charged with heavy classic artillery of Ph&oelig;bus and Neptune
and Tellus and Hymen, than there is between the straightforward agents
of their own destiny whom we meet in the first <i>Hamlet</i> and the
obliquely moving patients who veer sideways to their doom in the second.</p>
<p>This minor transformation of style in the inner play, made solely
with the evident view of marking the distinction between its duly artificial
forms of speech and the duly natural forms of speech passing between
the spectators, is but one among innumerable indications which only
a purblind perversity of prepossession can overlook of the especial
store set by Shakespeare himself on this favourite work, and the exceptional
pains taken by him to preserve it for aftertime in such fullness of
finished form as might make it worthiest of profound and perpetual study
by the light of far other lamps than illuminate the stage.&nbsp; Of
all vulgar errors the most wanton, the most wilful, and the most resolutely
tenacious of life, is that belief bequeathed from the days of Pope,
in which it was pardonable, to the days of Mr. Carlyle, in which it
is not excusable, to the effect that Shakespeare threw off <i>Hamlet</i>
as an eagle may moult a feather or a fool may break a jest; that he
dropped his work as a bird may drop an egg or a sophist a fallacy; that
he wrote &ldquo;for gain, not glory,&rdquo; or that having written <i>Hamlet</i>
he thought it nothing very wonderful to have written.&nbsp; For himself
to have written, he possibly, nay probably, did not think it anything
miraculous; but that he was in the fullest degree conscious of its wonderful
positive worth to all men for all time, we have the best evidence possible&mdash;his
own; and that not by mere word of mouth but by actual stroke of hand.&nbsp;
Ben Jonson might shout aloud over his own work on a public stage, &ldquo;By
God &rsquo;tis good,&rdquo; and so for all its real goodness and his
real greatness make sure that both the workman and his work should be
less unnaturally than unreasonably laughed at; Shakespeare knew a better
way of showing confidence in himself, but he showed not a whit less
confidence.&nbsp; Scene by scene, line for line, stroke upon stroke
and touch after touch, he went over all the old laboured ground again;
and not to ensure success in his own day and fill his pockets with contemporary
pence, but merely and wholly with a purpose to make it worthy of himself
and his future students.&nbsp; Pence and praise enough it had evidently
brought him in from the first.&nbsp; No more palpable proof of this
can be desired than the instantaneous attacks on it, the jeers, howls,
hoots and hisses of which a careful ear may catch some far faint echo
even yet; the fearful and furtive yelp from beneath of the masked and
writhing poeticule, the shrill reverberation all around it of plagiarism
and parody.&nbsp; Not one single alteration in the whole play can possibly
have been made with a view to stage effect or to present popularity
and profit; or we must suppose that Shakespeare, however great as a
man, was naturally even greater as a fool.&nbsp; There is a class of
mortals to whom this inference is always grateful&mdash;to whom the
fond belief that every great man must needs be a great fool would seem
always to afford real comfort and support: happy, in Prior&rsquo;s phrase,
could their inverted rule prove every great fool to be a great man.&nbsp;
Every change in the text of <i>Hamlet</i> has impaired its fitness for
the stage and increased its value for the closet in exact and perfect
proportion.&nbsp; Now, this is not a matter of opinion&mdash;of Mr.
Pope&rsquo;s opinion or Mr. Carlyle&rsquo;s; it is a matter of fact
and evidence.&nbsp; Even in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time the actors threw
out his additions; they throw out these very same additions in our own.&nbsp;
The one especial speech, if any one such especial speech there be, in
which the personal genius of Shakespeare soars up to the very highest
of its height and strikes down to the very deepest of its depth, is
passed over by modern actors; it was cut away by Hemings and Condell.&nbsp;
We may almost assume it as certain that no boards have ever echoed&mdash;at
least, more than once or twice&mdash;to the supreme soliloquy of Hamlet.&nbsp;
Those words which combine the noblest pleading ever proffered for the
rights of human reason with the loftiest vindication ever uttered of
those rights, no mortal ear within our knowledge has ever heard spoken
on the stage.&nbsp; A convocation even of all priests could not have
been more unhesitatingly unanimous in its rejection than seems to have
been the hereditary verdict of all actors.&nbsp; It could hardly have
been found worthier of theological than it has been found of theatrical
condemnation.&nbsp; Yet, beyond all question, magnificent as is that
monologue on suicide and doubt which has passed from a proverb into
a byword, it is actually eclipsed and distanced at once on philosophic
and on poetical grounds by the later soliloquy on reason and resolution.</p>
<p>That Shakespeare was in the genuine sense&mdash;that is, in the best
and highest and widest meaning of the term&mdash;a free thinker, this
otherwise practically and avowedly superfluous effusion of all inmost
thought appears to me to supply full and sufficient evidence for the
conviction of every candid and rational man.&nbsp; To that loftiest
and most righteous title which any just and reasoning soul can ever
deserve to claim, the greatest save one of all poetic thinkers has thus
made good his right for ever.</p>
<p>I trust it will be taken as no breach of my past pledge to abstain
from all intrusion on the sacred ground of Gigadibs and the Germans,
if I venture to indicate a touch inserted by Shakespeare for no other
perceptible or conceivable purpose than to obviate by anticipation the
indomitable and ineradicable fallacy of criticism which would find the
keynote of Hamlet&rsquo;s character in the quality of irresolution.&nbsp;
I may observe at once that the misconception involved in such a reading
of the riddle ought to have been evident even without this episodical
stroke of illustration.&nbsp; In any case it should be plain to any
reader that the signal characteristic of Hamlet&rsquo;s inmost nature
is by no means irresolution or hesitation or any form of weakness, but
rather the strong conflux of contending forces.&nbsp; That during four
whole acts Hamlet cannot or does not make up his mind to any direct
and deliberate action against his uncle is true enough; true, also,
we may say, that Hamlet had somewhat more of mind than another man to
make up, and might properly want somewhat more time than might another
man to do it in; but not, I venture to say in spite of Goethe, through
innate inadequacy to his task and unconquerable weakness of the will;
not, I venture to think in spite of Hugo, through immedicable scepticism
of the spirit and irremediable propensity to nebulous intellectual refinement.&nbsp;
One practical point in the action of the play precludes us from accepting
so ready a solution of the riddle as is suggested either by the simple
theory of half-heartedness or by the simple hypothesis of doubt.&nbsp;
There is absolutely no other reason, we might say there was no other
excuse, for the introduction or intrusion of an else superfluous episode
into a play which was already, and which remains even after all possible
excisions, one of the longest plays on record.&nbsp; The compulsory
expedition of Hamlet to England, his discovery by the way of the plot
laid against his life, his interception of the King&rsquo;s letter and
his forgery of a substitute for it against the lives of the King&rsquo;s
agents, the ensuing adventure of the sea-fight, with Hamlet&rsquo;s
daring act of hot-headed personal intrepidity, his capture and subsequent
release on terms giving no less patent proof of his cool-headed and
ready-witted courage and resource than the attack had afforded of his
physically impulsive and even impetuous hardihood&mdash;all this serves
no purpose whatever but that of exhibiting the instant and almost unscrupulous
resolution of Hamlet&rsquo;s character in time of practical need.&nbsp;
But for all that he or Hamlet has got by it, Shakespeare might too evidently
have spared his pains; and for all this voice as of one crying in a
wilderness, Hamlet will too surely remain to the majority of students,
not less than to all actors and all editors and all critics, the standing
type and embodied emblem of irresolution, half-heartedness, and doubt.</p>
<p>That Hamlet should seem at times to accept for himself, and even
to enforce by reiteration of argument upon his conscience and his reason,
some such conviction or suspicion as to his own character, tells much
rather in disfavour than in favour of its truth.&nbsp; A man whose natural
temptation was to swerve, whose inborn inclination was to shrink and
skulk aside from duty and from action, would hardly be the first and
last person to suspect his own weakness, the one only unbiassed judge
and witness of sufficiently sharp-sighted candour and accuracy to estimate
aright his poverty of nature and the malformation of his mind.&nbsp;
But the high-hearted and tender-conscienced Hamlet, with his native
bias towards introspection intensified and inflamed and directed and
dilated at once by one imperative pressure and oppression of unavoidable
and unalterable circumstance, was assuredly and exactly the one only
man to be troubled by any momentary fear that such might indeed be the
solution of his riddle, and to feel or to fancy for the moment some
kind of ease and relief in the sense of that very trouble.&nbsp; A born
doubter would have doubted even of Horatio; hardly can all positive
and almost palpable evidence of underhand instigation and inspired good
intentions induce Hamlet for some time to doubt even of Ophelia.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>The entrance to the third period of Shakespeare is like the entrance
to that lost and lesser Paradise of old,</p>
<blockquote><p>With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lear, Othello, Macbeth, Coriolanus, Antony, Timon, these are names
indeed of something more than tragic purport.&nbsp; Only in the sunnier
distance beyond, where the sunset of Shakespeare&rsquo;s imagination
seems to melt or flow back into the sunrise, do we discern Prospero
beside Miranda, Florizel by Perdita, Palamon with Arcite, the same knightly
and kindly Duke Theseus as of old; and above them all, and all others
of his divine and human children, the crowning and final and ineffable
figure of Imogen.</p>
<p>Of all Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, <i>King Lear</i> is unquestionably
that in which he has come nearest to the height and to the likeness
of the one tragic poet on any side greater than himself whom the world
in all its ages has ever seen born of time.&nbsp; It is by far the most
&AElig;schylean of his works; the most elemental and prim&aelig;val,
the most oceanic and Titanic in conception.&nbsp; He deals here with
no subtleties as in <i>Hamlet</i>, with no conventions as in <i>Othello</i>:
there is no question of &ldquo;a divided duty&rdquo; or a problem half
insoluble, a matter of country and connection, of family or of race;
we look upward and downward, and in vain, into the deepest things of
nature, into the highest things of providence; to the roots of life,
and to the stars; from the roots that no God waters to the stars which
give no man light; over a world full of death and life without resting-place
or guidance.</p>
<p>But in one main point it differs radically from the work and the
spirit of &AElig;schylus.&nbsp; Its fatalism is of a darker and harder
nature.&nbsp; To Prometheus the fetters of the lord and enemy of mankind
were bitter; upon Orestes the hand of heaven was laid too heavily to
bear; yet in the not utterly infinite or everlasting distance we see
beyond them the promise of the morning on which mystery and justice
shall be made one; when righteousness and omnipotence at last shall
kiss each other.&nbsp; But on the horizon of Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragic
fatalism we see no such twilight of atonement, such pledge of reconciliation
as this.&nbsp; Requital, redemption, amends, equity, explanation, pity
and mercy, are words without a meaning here.</p>
<blockquote><p>As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods;<br />
They kill us for their sport.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is no need of the Eumenides, children of Night everlasting;
for here is very Night herself.</p>
<p>The words just cited are not casual or episodical; they strike the
keynote of the whole poem, lay the keystone of the whole arch of thought.&nbsp;
There is no contest of conflicting forces, no judgment so much as by
casting of lots: far less is there any light of heavenly harmony or
of heavenly wisdom, of Apollo or Athene from above.&nbsp; We have heard
much and often from theologians of the light of revelation: and some
such thing indeed we find in &AElig;schylus: but the darkness of revelation
is here.</p>
<p>For in this the most terrible work of human genius it is with the
very springs and sources of nature that her student has set himself
to deal.&nbsp; The veil of the temple of our humanity is rent in twain.&nbsp;
Nature herself, we might say, is revealed&mdash;and revealed as unnatural.&nbsp;
In face of such a world as this a man might be forgiven who should pray
that chaos might come again.&nbsp; Nowhere else in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
work or in the universe of jarring lives are the lines of character
and event so broadly drawn or so sharply cut.&nbsp; Only the supreme
self-command of this one poet could so mould and handle such types as
to restrain and prevent their passing from the abnormal into the monstrous:
yet even as much as this, at least in all cases but one, it surely has
accomplished.&nbsp; In Regan alone would it be, I think, impossible
to find a touch or trace of anything less vile than it was devilish.&nbsp;
Even Goneril has her one splendid hour, her fire-flaught of hellish
glory; when she treads under foot the half-hearted goodness, the wordy
and windy though sincere abhorrence, which is all that the mild and
impotent revolt of Albany can bring to bear against her imperious and
dauntless devilhood; when she flaunts before the eyes of her &ldquo;milk-livered&rdquo;
and &ldquo;moral fool&rdquo; the coming banners of France about the
&ldquo;plumed helm&rdquo; of his slayer.</p>
<p>On the other side, Kent is the exception which answers to Regan on
this.&nbsp; Cordelia, the brotherless Antigone of our stage, has one
passing touch of intolerance for what her sister was afterwards to brand
as indiscretion and dotage in their father, which redeems her from the
charge of perfection.&nbsp; Like Imogen, she is not too inhumanly divine
for the sense of divine irritation.&nbsp; Godlike though they be, their
very godhead is human and feminine; and only therefore credible, and
only therefore adorable.&nbsp; Cloten and Regan, Goneril and Iachimo,
have power to stir and embitter the sweetness of their blood.&nbsp;
But for the contrast and even the contact of antagonists as abominable
as these, the gold of their spirit would be too refined, the lily of
their holiness too radiant, the violet of their virtue too sweet.&nbsp;
As it is, Shakespeare has gone down perforce among the blackest and
the basest things of nature to find anything so equally exceptional
in evil as properly to counterbalance and make bearable the excellence
and extremity of their goodness.&nbsp; No otherwise could either angel
have escaped the blame implied in the very attribute and epithet of
blameless.&nbsp; But where the possible depth of human hell is so foul
and unfathomable as it appears in the spirits which serve as foils to
these, we may endure that in them the inner height of heaven should
be no less immaculate and immeasurable.</p>
<p>It should be a truism wellnigh as musty as Hamlet&rsquo;s half cited
proverb, to enlarge upon the evidence given in <i>King Lear</i> of a
sympathy with the mass of social misery more wide and deep and direct
and bitter and tender than Shakespeare has shown elsewhere.&nbsp; But
as even to this day and even in respectable quarters the murmur is not
quite duly extinct which would charge on Shakespeare a certain share
of divine indifference to suffering, of godlike satisfaction and a less
than compassionate content, it is not yet perhaps utterly superfluous
to insist on the utter fallacy and falsity of their creed who whether
in praise or in blame would rank him to his credit or discredit among
such poets as on this side at least may be classed rather with Goethe
than with Shelley and with Gautier than with Hugo.&nbsp; A poet of revolution
he is not, as none of his country in that generation could have been:
but as surely as the author of <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> has approved
himself in the best and highest sense of the word at least potentially
a republican, so surely has the author of <i>King Lear</i> avowed himself
in the only good and rational sense of the words a spiritual if not
a political democrat and socialist.</p>
<p>It is only, I think, in this most tragic of tragedies that the sovereign
lord and incarnate god of pity and terror can be said to have struck
with all his strength a chord of which the resonance could excite such
angry agony and heartbreak of wrath as that of the brother kings when
they smote their staffs against the ground in fierce imperious anguish
of agonised and rebellious compassion, at the oracular cry of Calchas
for the innocent blood of Iphigenia.&nbsp; The doom even of Desdemona
seems as much less morally intolerable as it is more logically inevitable
than the doom of Cordelia.&nbsp; But doubtless the fatalism of <i>Othello</i>
is as much darker and harder than that of any third among the plays
of Shakespeare, as it is less dark and hard than the fatalism of <i>King
Lear</i>.&nbsp; For upon the head of the very noblest man whom even
omnipotence or Shakespeare could ever call to life he has laid a burden
in one sense yet heavier than the burden of Lear, insomuch as the sufferer
can with somewhat less confidence of universal appeal proclaim himself
a man more sinned against than sinning.</p>
<p>And yet, if ever man after Lear might lift up his voice in that protest,
it would assuredly be none other than Othello.&nbsp; He is in all the
prosperous days of his labour and his triumph so utterly and wholly
nobler than the self-centred and wayward king, that the capture of his
soul and body in the unimaginable snare of Iago seems a yet blinder
and more unrighteous blow</p>
<blockquote><p>Struck by the envious wrath of man or God</p>
</blockquote>
<p>than ever fell on the old white head of that child-changed father.&nbsp;
But at least he is destroyed by the stroke of a mightier hand than theirs
who struck down Lear.&nbsp; As surely as Othello is the noblest man
of man&rsquo;s making, Iago is the most perfect evildoer, the most potent
demi-devil.&nbsp; It is of course the merest commonplace to say as much,
and would be no less a waste of speech to add the half comfortable reflection
that it is in any case no shame to fall by such a hand.&nbsp; But this
subtlest and strangest work of Shakespeare&rsquo;s admits and requires
some closer than common scrutiny.&nbsp; Coleridge has admirably described
the first great soliloquy which opens to us the pit of hell within as
&ldquo;the motive-hunting of a motiveless malignity.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
subtle and profound and just as is this definitive appreciation, there
is more in the matter yet than even this.&nbsp; It is not only that
Iago, so to speak, half tries to make himself half believe that Othello
has wronged him, and that the thought of it gnaws him inly like a poisonous
mineral: though this also be true, it is not half the truth&mdash;nor
half that half again.&nbsp; Malignant as he is, the very subtlest and
strongest component of his complex nature is not even malignity.&nbsp;
It is the instinct of what Mr. Carlyle would call an inarticulate poet.&nbsp;
In his immortal study on the affair of the diamond necklace, the most
profound and potent humourist of his country in his century has unwittingly
touched on the mainspring of Iago&rsquo;s character&mdash;&ldquo;the
very pulse of the machine.&rdquo;&nbsp; He describes his Circe de la
Mothe-Valois as a practical dramatic poet or playwright at least in
lieu of play-writer: while indicating how and wherefore, with all her
constructive skill and rhythmic art in action, such genius as hers so
differs from the genius of Shakespeare that she undeniably could not
have written a <i>Hamlet</i>.&nbsp; Neither could Iago have written
an <i>Othello</i>.&nbsp; (From this theorem, by the way, a reasoner
or a casuist benighted enough to prefer articulate poets to inarticulate,
Shakespeare to Cromwell, a fair Vittoria Colonna to a &ldquo;foul Circe-Meg&aelig;ra,&rdquo;
and even such a strategist as Homer to such a strategist as Frederic-William,
would not illogically draw such conclusions or infer such corollaries
as might result in opinions hardly consonant with the Teutonic-Titanic
evangel of the preacher who supplied him with his thesis.)&nbsp; &ldquo;But
what he can do, that he will&rdquo;: and if it be better to make a tragedy
than to write one, to act a poem than to sing it, we must allow to Iago
a station in the hierarchy of poets very far in advance of his creator&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
None of the great inarticulate may more justly claim place and precedence.&nbsp;
With all his poetic gift, he has no poetic weakness.&nbsp; Almost any
creator but his would have given him some grain of spite or some spark
of lust after Desdemona.&nbsp; To Shakespeare&rsquo;s Iago she is no
more than is a rhyme to another and articulate poet. <a name="citation179"></a><a href="#footnote179">{179}</a>&nbsp;
His stanza must at any rate and at all costs be polished: to borrow
the metaphor used by Mr. Carlyle in apologetic illustration of a royal
hero&rsquo;s peculiar system of levying recruits for his colossal brigade.&nbsp;
He has within him a sense or conscience of power incomparable: and this
power shall not be left, in Hamlet&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;to fust in
him unused.&rdquo;&nbsp; A genuine and thorough capacity for human lust
or hate would diminish and degrade the supremacy of his evil.&nbsp;
He is almost as far above or beyond vice as he is beneath or beyond
virtue.&nbsp; And this it is that makes him impregnable and invulnerable.&nbsp;
When once he has said it, we know as well as he that thenceforth he
never will speak word.&nbsp; We could smile almost as we can see him
to have smiled at Gratiano&rsquo;s most ignorant and empty threat, being
well assured that torments will in no wise ope his lips: that as surely
and as truthfully as ever did the tortured philosopher before him, he
might have told his tormentors that they did but bruise the coating,
batter the crust, or break the shell of Iago.&nbsp; Could we imagine
a far other lost spirit than Farinata degli Uberti&rsquo;s endowed with
Farinata&rsquo;s might of will, and transferred from the sepulchres
of fire to the dykes of Malebolge, we might conceive something of Iago&rsquo;s
attitude in hell&mdash;of his unalterable and indomitable posture for
all eternity.&nbsp; As though it were possible and necessary that in
some one point the extremities of all conceivable good and of all imaginable
evil should meet and mix together in a new &ldquo;marriage of heaven
and hell,&rdquo; the action in passion of the most devilish among all
the human damned could hardly be other than that of the most godlike
among all divine saviours&mdash;the figure of Iago than a reflection
by hell-fire of the figure of Prometheus.</p>
<p>Between Iago and Othello the position of Desdemona is precisely that
defined with such quaint sublimity of fancy in the old English byword&mdash;&ldquo;between
the devil and the deep sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Deep and pure and strong and
adorable always and terrible and pitiless on occasion as the sea is
the great soul of the glorious hero to whom she has given herself; and
what likeness of man&rsquo;s enemy from Satan down to Mephistopheles
could be matched for danger and for dread against the good bluff soldierly
trustworthy figure of honest Iago?&nbsp; The rough license of his tongue
at once takes warrant from his good soldiership and again gives warrant
for his honesty: so that in a double sense it does him yeoman&rsquo;s
service, and that twice told.&nbsp; It is pitifully ludicrous to see
him staged to the show like a member&mdash;and a very inefficient member&mdash;of
the secret police.&nbsp; But it would seem impossible for actors to
understand that he is not a would-be detective, an aspirant for the
honours of a Vidocq, a candidate for the laurels of a Vautrin: that
he is no less than Lepidus, or than Antony&rsquo;s horse, &ldquo;a tried
and valiant soldier.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is perhaps natural that the two
deepest and subtlest of all Shakespeare&rsquo;s intellectual studies
in good and evil should be the two most painfully misused and misunderstood
alike by his commentators and his fellows of the stage: it is certainly
undeniable that no third figure of his creation has ever been on both
sides as persistently misconceived and misrepresented with such desperate
pertinacity as Hamlet and Iago.</p>
<p>And it is only when Iago is justly appreciated that we can justly
appreciate either Othello or Desdemona.&nbsp; This again should surely
be no more than the truism that it sounds; but practically it would
seem to be no less than an adventurous and audacious paradox.&nbsp;
Remove or deform or diminish or modify the dominant features of the
destroyer, and we have but the eternal and vulgar figures of jealousy
and innocence, newly vamped and veneered and padded and patched up for
the stalest purposes of puppetry.&nbsp; As it is, when Coleridge asks
&ldquo;which do we pity the most&rdquo; at the fall of the curtain,
we can surely answer, Othello.&nbsp; Noble as are the &ldquo;most blessed
conditions&rdquo; of &ldquo;the gentle Desdemona,&rdquo; he is yet the
nobler of the two; and has suffered more in one single pang than she
could suffer in life or in death.</p>
<p>But if <i>Othello</i> be the most pathetic, <i>King Lear</i> the
most terrible, <i>Hamlet</i> the subtlest and deepest work of Shakespeare,
the highest in abrupt and steep simplicity of epic tragedy is <i>Macbeth</i>.&nbsp;
There needs no ghost come from the grave, any reader may too probably
remark, to tell us this.&nbsp; But in the present generation such novelties
have been unearthed regarding Shakespeare that the reassertion of an
old truth may seem to have upon it some glittering reflection from the
brazen brightness of a brand-new lie.&nbsp; Have not certain wise men
of the east of England&mdash;Cantabrigian Magi, led by the star of their
goddess Mathesis (&ldquo;mad Mathesis,&rdquo; as a daring poet was once
ill-advised enough to dub her doubtful deity in defiance of scansion
rather than of truth)&mdash;have they not detected in the very heart
of this tragedy the &ldquo;paddling palms and pinching fingers&rdquo;
of Thomas Middleton?</p>
<p>To the simpler eyes of less learned Thebans than these&mdash;Thebes,
by the way, was Dryden&rsquo;s irreverent name for Cambridge, the nursing
mother of &ldquo;his green unknowing youth,&rdquo; when that &ldquo;renegade&rdquo;
was recreant enough to compliment Oxford at her expense as the chosen
Athens of &ldquo;his riper age&rdquo;&mdash;the likelihood is only too
evident that the sole text we possess of <i>Macbeth</i> has not been
interpolated but mutilated.&nbsp; In their version of <i>Othello</i>,
remarkably enough, the &ldquo;player-editors,&rdquo; contrary to their
wont, have added to the treasure-house of their text one of the most
precious jewels that ever the prodigal afterthought of a great poet
bestowed upon the rapture of his readers.&nbsp; Some of these, by way
of thanksgiving, have complained with a touch of petulance that it was
out of place and superfluous in the setting: nay, that it was incongruous
with all the circumstances&mdash;out of tone and out of harmony and
out of keeping with character and tune and time.&nbsp; In other lips
indeed than Othello&rsquo;s, at the crowning minute of culminant agony,
the rush of imaginative reminiscence which brings back upon his eyes
and ears the lightning foam and tideless thunder of the Pontic sea might
seem a thing less natural than sublime.&nbsp; But Othello has the passion
of a poet closed in as it were and shut up behind the passion of a hero.&nbsp;
For all his practical readiness of martial eye and ruling hand in action,
he is also in his season &ldquo;of imagination all compact.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Therefore it is that in the face and teeth of all devils akin to Iago
that hell could send forth to hiss at her election, we feel and recognise
the spotless exaltation, the sublime and sun-bright purity, of Desdemona&rsquo;s
inevitable and invulnerable love.&nbsp; When once we likewise have seen
Othello&rsquo;s visage in his mind, we see too how much more of greatness
is in this mind than in another hero&rsquo;s.&nbsp; For such an one,
even a boy may well think how thankfully and joyfully he would lay down
his life.&nbsp; Other friends we have of Shakespeare&rsquo;s giving
whom we love deeply and well, if hardly with such love as could weep
for him all the tears of the body and all the blood of the heart: but
there is none we love like Othello.</p>
<p>I must part from his presence again for a season, and return to my
topic in the text of <i>Macbeth</i>.&nbsp; That it is piteously rent
and ragged and clipped and garbled in some of its earlier scenes, the
rough construction and the poltfoot metre, lame sense and limping verse,
each maimed and mangled subject of players&rsquo; and printers&rsquo;
most treasonable tyranny, contending as it were to seem harsher than
the other, combine in this contention to bear indisputable and intolerable
witness.&nbsp; Only where the witches are, and one more potent and more
terrible than all witches and all devils at their beck, can we be sure
that such traitors have not robbed us of one touch from Shakespeare&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; The second scene of the play at least bears marks of such
handling as the brutal Shakespearean Hector&rsquo;s of the &ldquo;mangled
Myrmidons&rdquo;; it is too visibly &ldquo;noseless, handless, hacked
and chipped&rdquo; as it comes to us, crying on Hemings and Condell.&nbsp;
And it is in this unlucky scene that unkindly criticism has not unsuccessfully
sought for the gravest faults of language and manner to be found in
Shakespeare.&nbsp; For certainly it cannot be cleared from the charge
of a style stiffened and swollen with clumsy braid and crabbed bombast.&nbsp;
But against the weird sisters, and her who sits above them and apart,
more awful than Hecate&rsquo;s very self, no mangling hand has been
stretched forth; no blight of mistranslation by perversion has fallen
upon the words which interpret and expound the hidden things of their
evil will.</p>
<p>To one tragedy as to one comedy of Shakespeare&rsquo;s, the casual
or the natural union of especial popularity with especial simplicity
in selection and in treatment of character makes it as superfluous as
it would be difficult to attempt any application of analytical criticism.&nbsp;
There is nothing in them of a nature so compound or so complex as to
call for solution or resolution into its primal elements.&nbsp; Here
there is some genuine ground for the generally baseless and delusive
opinion of self-complacent sciolism that he who runs may read Shakespeare.&nbsp;
These two plays it is hardly worth while to point out by name: all probable
readers will know them at once for <i>Macbeth</i> and <i>As You Like
It</i>.&nbsp; There can hardly be a single point of incident or of character
on which the youngest reader will not find himself at one with the oldest,
the dullest with the brightest among the scholars of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
It would be an equal waste of working hours or of playtime if any of
these should devote any part of either a whole-schoolday or a holiday
to remark or to rhapsody on the character of Macbeth or of Orlando,
of Rosalind or of Lady Macbeth.&nbsp; He that runs, let him read: and
he that has ears, let him hear.</p>
<p>I cannot but think that enough at least of time has been spent if
not wasted by able and even by eminent men on examination of <i>Coriolanus</i>
with regard to its political aspect or bearing upon social questions.&nbsp;
It is from first to last, for all its turmoil of battle and clamour
of contentious factions, rather a private and domestic than a public
or historical tragedy.&nbsp; As in <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> the family
had been so wholly subordinated to the state, and all personal interests
so utterly dominated by the preponderance of national duties, that even
the sweet and sublime figure of Portia passing in her &ldquo;awful loveliness&rdquo;
was but as a profile half caught in the background of an episode, so
here on the contrary the whole force of the final impression is not
that of a conflict between patrician and plebeian, but solely that of
a match of passions played out for life and death between a mother and
a son.&nbsp; The partisans of oligarchic or democratic systems may wrangle
at their will over the supposed evidences of Shakespeare&rsquo;s prejudice
against this creed and prepossession in favour of that: a third bystander
may rejoice in the proof thus established of his impartial indifference
towards either: it is all nothing to the real point in hand.&nbsp; The
subject of the whole play is not the exile&rsquo;s revolt, the rebel&rsquo;s
repentance, or the traitor&rsquo;s reward, but above all it is the son&rsquo;s
tragedy.&nbsp; The inscription on the plinth of this tragic statue is
simply to Volumnia Victrix.</p>
<p>A loftier or a more perfect piece of man&rsquo;s work was never done
in all the world than this tragedy of <i>Coriolanus</i>: the one fit
and crowning epithet for its companion or successor is that bestowed
by Coleridge&mdash;&ldquo;the most wonderful.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would
seem a sign or birthmark of only the greatest among poets that they
should be sure to rise instantly for awhile above the very highest of
their native height at the touch of a thought of Cleopatra.&nbsp; So
was it, as we all know, with William Shakespeare: so is it, as we all
see, with Victor Hugo.&nbsp; As we feel in the marvellous and matchless
verses of <i>Zim-Zizimi</i> all the splendour and fragrance and miracle
of her mere bodily presence, so from her first imperial dawn on the
stage of Shakespeare to the setting of that eastern star behind a pall
of undissolving cloud we feel the charm and the terror and the mystery
of her absolute and royal soul.&nbsp; Byron wrote once to Moore, with
how much truth or sincerity those may guess who would care to know,
that his friend&rsquo;s first &ldquo;confounded book&rdquo; of thin
prurient jingle (&ldquo;we call it a mellisonant tingle-tangle,&rdquo;
as Randolph&rsquo;s mock Oberon says of a stolen sheep-bell) had been
the first cause of all his erratic or erotic frailties: it is not impossible
that spirits of another sort may remember that to their own innocent
infantine perceptions the first obscure electric revelation of what
Blake calls &ldquo;the Eternal Female&rdquo; was given through a blind
wondering thrill of childish rapture by a lightning on the baby dawn
of their senses and their soul from the sunrise of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Cleopatra.</p>
<p>Never has he given such proof of his incomparable instinct for abstinence
from the wrong thing as well as achievement of the right.&nbsp; He has
utterly rejected and disdained all occasion of setting her off by means
of any lesser foil than all the glory of the world with all its empires.&nbsp;
And we need not Antony&rsquo;s example to show us that these are less
than straws in the balance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Entre elle et l&rsquo;univers qui s&rsquo;offraient &agrave;
la fois<br />
Il h&eacute;sita, l&acirc;chant le monde dans son choix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even as that Roman grasp relaxed and let fall the world, so has Shakespeare&rsquo;s
self let go for awhile his greater world of imagination, with all its
all but infinite variety of life and thought and action, for love of
that more infinite variety which custom could not stale.&nbsp; Himself
a second and a yet more fortunate Antony, he has once more laid a world,
and a world more wonderful than ever, at her feet.&nbsp; He has put
aside for her sake all other forms and figures of womanhood; he, father
or creator of Rosalind, of Cordelia, of Desdemona, and of Imogen, he
too, like the sun-god and sender of all song, has anchored his eyes
on her whom &ldquo;Ph&oelig;bus&rsquo; amorous pinches&rdquo; could
not leave &ldquo;black,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;wrinkled deep in time&rdquo;;
on that incarnate and imperishable &ldquo;spirit of sense,&rdquo; to
whom at the very last</p>
<blockquote><p>The stroke of death is as a lover&rsquo;s pinch,<br />
That hurts, and is desired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To him, as to the dying husband of Octavia, this creature of his
own hand might have boasted herself that the loveliest and purest among
all her sisters of his begetting,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with
her modest eyes<br />
And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour,<br />
Demurring upon me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To sum up, Shakespeare has elsewhere given us in ideal incarnation
the perfect mother, the perfect wife, the perfect daughter, the perfect
mistress, or the perfect maiden: here only once for all he has given
us the perfect and the everlasting woman.</p>
<p>And what a world of great men and great things, &ldquo;high actions
and high passions,&rdquo; is this that he has spread under her for a
footcloth or hung behind her for a curtain!&nbsp; The descendant of
that other his ancestral Alcides, late offshoot of the god whom he loved
and who so long was loth to leave him, is here as in history the visible
one man revealed who could grapple for a second with very Rome and seem
to throw it, more lightly than he could cope with Cleopatra.&nbsp; And
not the Roman Landor himself could see or make us see more clearly than
has his fellow provincial of Warwickshire that first imperial nephew
of her great first paramour, who was to his actual uncle even such a
foil and counterfeit and perverse and prosperous parody as the son of
Hortense Beauharnais of Saint-Leu to the son of Letizia Buonaparte of
Ajaccio.&nbsp; For Shakespeare too, like Landor, had watched his &ldquo;sweet
Octavius&rdquo; smilingly and frowningly &ldquo;draw under nose the
knuckle of forefinger&rdquo; as he looked out upon the trail of innocent
blood after the bright receding figure of his brave young kinsman.&nbsp;
The fair-faced false &ldquo;present God&rdquo; of his poetic parasites,
the smooth triumphant patron and preserver with the heart of ice and
iron, smiles before us to the very life.&nbsp; It is of no account now
to remember that</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he at Philippi kept<br />
His sword even like a dancer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>for the sword of Antony that struck for him is in the renegade hand
of Dercetas.</p>
<p>I have said nothing of Enobarbus or of Eros, the fugitive once ruined
by his flight and again redeemed by the death-agony of his dark and
doomed repentance, or the freedman transfigured by a death more fair
than freedom through the glory of the greatness of his faith: for who
can speak of all things or of half that are in Shakespeare?&nbsp; And
who can speak worthily of any?</p>
<p>I am come now to that strange part of a task too high for me, where
I must needs speak not only (as may indeed well be) unworthily, but
also (as may well seem) unlovingly, of some certain portions in the
mature and authentic work of Shakespeare.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though it be
honest, it is never good&rdquo; to do so: yet here I cannot choose but
speak plainly after my own poor conscience, and risk all chances of
chastisement as fearful as any once threatened for her too faithful
messenger by the heart-stricken wrath of Cleopatra.</p>
<p>In the greater part of this third period, taking a swift and general
view of it for contrast or comparison of qualities with the second,
we constantly find beauty and melody, transfigured into harmony and
sublimity; an exchange unquestionably for the better: but in certain
stages, or only perhaps in a single stage of it, we frequently find
humour and reality supplanted by realism and obscenity; an exchange
undeniably for the worse.&nbsp; The note of his earliest comic style
was often a boyish or a birdlike wantonness, very capable of such liberties
and levities as those of Lesbia&rsquo;s sparrow with the lip or bosom
of his mistress; as notably in the parts of Boyet and Mercutio: and
indeed there is a bright vein of mere wordy wilfulness running throughout
the golden youth of the two plays which connects <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost</i> with <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> as by a thread of floss silk not
always &ldquo;most excellently ravelled,&rdquo; nor often unspotted
or unentangled.&nbsp; In the second period this gaiety was replaced
by the utmost frankness and fullness of humour, as a boy&rsquo;s merry
madness by the witty wisdom of a man: but now for a time it would seem
as if the good comic qualities of either period were displaced and ousted
by mere coarseness and crudity like that of a hard harsh photograph.&nbsp;
This ultra-Circean transformation of spirit and brutification of speech
we do not find in the lighter interludes of great and perfect tragedy:
for the porter in <i>Macbeth</i> makes hardly an exception worth naming.&nbsp;
It is when we come upon the singular little group of two or three plays
not accurately definable at all but roughly describable as tragi-comedies,
or more properly in two cases at least as tragedies docked of their
natural end, curtailed of the due catastrophe&mdash;it is then that
we find for the swift sad bright lightnings of laughter from the lips
of the sweet and bitter fool whose timeless disappearance from the stage
of <i>King Lear</i> seems for once a sure sign of inexplicable weariness
or forgetfulness on Shakespeare&rsquo;s part, so nauseous and so sorry
a substitute as the fetid fun and rancid ribaldry of Pandarus and Thersites.&nbsp;
I must have leave to say that the coincidence of these two in the scheme
of a single play is a thing hardly bearable by men who object to too
strong a savour of those too truly &ldquo;Eternal Cesspools&rdquo; over
which the first of living humourists holds as it were for ever an everlasting
nose&mdash;or rather, in one sense, does not hold but expand it for
the fuller inhalation of their too congenial fumes with an apparent
relish which will always seem the most deplorable to those who the most
gratefully and reasonably admire that high heroic genius, for love of
which the wiser sort of men must finally forgive all the noisy aberrations
of his misanthropy and philobulgary, anti-Gallican and Russolatrous
insanities of perverse and morbid eloquence.</p>
<p>The three detached or misclassified plays of Shakespeare in which
alone a reverent and reasonable critic might perhaps find something
rationally and really exceptionable have also this far other quality
in common, that in them as in his topmost tragedies of the same period
either the exaltation of his eloquence touches the very highest point
of expressible poetry, or his power of speculation alternately sounds
the gulfs and scales the summits of all imaginable thought.&nbsp; In
all three of them the power of passionate and imaginative eloquence
is not only equal in spirit or essence but identical in figure or in
form: in those two of them which deal almost as much with speculative
intelligence as with poetic action and passion, the tones and methods,
types and objects of thought, are also not equal only but identical.&nbsp;
An all but absolute brotherhood in thought and style and tone and feeling
unites the quasi-tragedy of <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> with what in
the lamentable default of as apt a phrase in English I must call by
its proper designation in French the <i>trag&eacute;die manqu&eacute;e</i>
of <i>Measure for Measure</i>.&nbsp; In the simply romantic fragment
of the Shakespearean <i>Pericles</i>, where there was no call and no
place for the poetry of speculative or philosophic intelligence, there
is the same positive and unmistakable identity of imaginative and passionate
style.</p>
<p>I cannot but conjecture that the habitual students of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
printed plays must have felt startled as by something of a shock when
the same year exposed for the expenditure of their sixpences two reasonably
correct editions of a play unknown to the boards in the likeness of
<i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, side by side or cheek by jowl with a most
unreasonably and unconscionably incorrect issue of a much older stage
favourite, now newly beautified and fortified, in <i>Pericles Prince
of Tyre</i>.&nbsp; Hitherto, ever since the appearance of his first
poem, and its instant acceptance by all classes from courtiers to courtesans
under a somewhat dubious and two-headed form of popular success,&mdash;&lsquo;vrai
succ&egrave;s de scandale s&rsquo;il en fut&rsquo;&mdash;even the potent
influence and unequivocal example of Rabelais had never once even in
passing or in seeming affected or infected the progressive and triumphal
genius of Shakespeare with a taint or touch of anything offensive to
healthier and cleanlier organs of perception than such as may belong
to a genuine or a pretending Puritan.&nbsp; But on taking in his hand
that one of these two new dramatic pamphlets which might first attract
him either by its double novelty as a never acted play or by a title
of yet more poetic and romantic associations than its fellow&rsquo;s,
such a purchaser as I have supposed, with his mind full of the sweet
rich fresh humour which he would feel a right to expect from Shakespeare,
could hardly have undergone less than a qualm or a pang of strong disrelish
and distaste on finding one of the two leading comic figures of the
play break in upon it at his entrance not even with &ldquo;a fool-born
jest,&rdquo; but with full-mouthed and foul-mouthed effusion of such
rank and rancorous personalities as might properly pollute the lips
even of some emulous descendant or antiquarian reincarnation of Thersites,
on application or even apprehension of a whip cracked in passing over
the assembled heads of a pseudocritical and mock-historic society.&nbsp;
In either case we moderns at least might haply desire the intervention
of a beadle&rsquo;s hand as heavy and a sceptral cudgel as knotty as
ever the son of Laertes applied to the shoulders of the first of the
type or the tribe of Thersites.&nbsp; For this brutal and brutish buffoon&mdash;I
am speaking of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Thersites&mdash;has no touch of humour
in all his currish composition: Shakespeare had none as nature has none
to spare for such dirty dogs as those of his kind or generation.&nbsp;
There is not even what Coleridge with such exquisite happiness defined
as being the quintessential property of Swift&mdash;&ldquo;<i>anima
Rabel&aelig;sii habitans in sicco</i>&mdash;the soul of Rabelais dwelling
in a dry place.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the fallen soul of Swift himself
at its lowest, dwelling in a place yet drier: the familiar spirit or
less than Socratic d&aelig;mon of the Dean informing the genius of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
And thus for awhile infected and possessed, the divine genius had not
power to re-inform and re-create the d&aelig;monic spirit by virtue
of its own clear essence.&nbsp; This wonderful play, one of the most
admirable among all the works of Shakespeare&rsquo;s immeasurable and
unfathomable intelligence, as it must always hold its natural high place
among the most admired, will always in all probability be also, and
as naturally, the least beloved of all.&nbsp; It would be as easy and
as profitable a problem to solve the Rabelaisian riddle of the bombinating
chim&aelig;ra with its potential or hypothetical faculty of deriving
sustenance from a course of diet on second intentions, as to read the
riddle of Shakespeare&rsquo;s design in the procreation of this yet
more mysterious and magnificent monster of a play.&nbsp; That on its
production in print it was formally announced as &ldquo;a new play never
staled with the stage, never clapper-clawed with the palms of the vulgar,&rdquo;
we know; must we infer or may we suppose that therefore it was not originally
written for the stage?&nbsp; Not all plays were which even at that date
appeared in print: yet it would seem something more than strange that
one such play, written simply for the study, should have been the extra-professional
work of Shakespeare: and yet again it would seem stranger that he should
have designed this prodigious nondescript or portent of supreme genius
for the public stage: and strangest of all, if so, that he should have
so designed it in vain.&nbsp; Perhaps after all a better than any German
or Germanising commentary on the subject would be the simple and summary
ejaculation of Celia&mdash;&ldquo;O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that out of all whooping!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The perplexities of the whole matter seem literally to crowd and thicken
upon us at every step.&nbsp; What ailed the man or any man to write
such a manner of dramatic poem at all? and having written, to keep it
beside him or let it out of his hands into stranger and more slippery
keeping, unacted and unprinted?&nbsp; A German will rush in with an
answer where an Englishman (<i>non angelus sed Anglus</i>) will naturally
fear to tread.</p>
<p>Alike in its most palpable perplexities and in its most patent splendours,
this political and philosophic and poetic problem, this hybrid and hundred-faced
and hydra-headed prodigy, at once defies and derides all definitive
comment.&nbsp; This however we may surely and confidently say of it,
that of all Shakespeare&rsquo;s offspring it is the one whose best things
lose least by extraction and separation from their context.&nbsp; That
some cynic had lately bitten him by the brain&mdash;and possibly a cynic
himself in a nearly rabid stage of anthropophobia&mdash;we might conclude
as reasonably from consideration of the whole as from examination of
the parts more especially and virulently affected: yet how much is here
also of hyper-Platonic subtlety and sublimity, of golden and Hybl&aelig;an
eloquence above the reach and beyond the snap of any cynic&rsquo;s tooth!&nbsp;
Shakespeare, as under the guidance at once for good and for evil of
his alternately Socratic and Swiftian familiar, has set himself as if
prepensely and on purpose to brutalise the type of Achilles and spiritualise
the type of Ulysses.&nbsp; The former is an enterprise never to be utterly
forgiven by any one who ever loved from the very birth of his boyhood
the very name of the son of the sea-goddess in the glorious words of
Mr. Browning&rsquo;s young first-born poem,</p>
<blockquote><p>Who stood beside the naked Swift-footed,<br />
And bound [his] forehead with Proserpine&rsquo;s hair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true, if that be any little compensation, that Hector and Andromache
fare here hardly better than he: while of the momentary presentation
of Helen on the dirtier boards of a stage more miry than the tub of
Diogenes I would not if I could and I must not though I would say so
much as one single proper word.&nbsp; The hysterics of the eponymous
hero and the harlotries of the eponymous heroine remove both alike beyond
the outer pale of all rational and manly sympathy; though Shakespeare&rsquo;s
self may never have exceeded or equalled for subtle and accurate and
bitter fidelity the study here given of an utterly light woman, shallow
and loose and dissolute in the most literal sense, rather than perverse
or unkindly or unclean; and though Keats alone in his most perfect mood
of lyric passion and burning vision as full of fragrance as of flame
could have matched and all but overmatched those passages in which the
rapture of Troilus makes pale and humble by comparison the keenest raptures
of Romeo.</p>
<p>The relative disfavour in which the play of <i>Measure for Measure</i>
has doubtless been at all times generally held is not in my opinion
simply explicable on the theory which of late years has been so powerfully
and plausibly advanced and advocated on the highest poetic or judicial
authority in France or in the world, that in the land of many-coloured
cant and many-coated hypocrisy the type of Angelo is something too much
a prototype or an autotype of the huge national vice of England.&nbsp;
This comment is in itself as surely just and true as it is incisive
and direct: but it will not cover by any manner of means the whole question.&nbsp;
The strong and radical objection distinctly brought forward against
this play, and strenuously supported by the wisest and the warmest devotee
among all the worshippers of Shakespeare, is not exactly this, that
the Puritan Angelo is exposed: it is that the Puritan Angelo is unpunished.&nbsp;
In the very words of Coleridge, it is that by his pardon and his marriage
&ldquo;the strong indignant claim of justice&rdquo; is &ldquo;baffled.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The expression is absolutely correct and apt: justice is not merely
evaded or ignored or even defied: she is both in the older and the newer
sense of the word directly and deliberately baffled; buffeted, outraged,
insulted, struck in the face.&nbsp; We are left hungry and thirsty after
having been made to thirst and hunger for some wholesome single grain
at least of righteous and too long retarded retribution: we are tricked
out of our dole, defeated of our due, lured and led on to look for some
equitable and satisfying upshot, defrauded and derided and sent empty
away.</p>
<p>That this play is in its very inmost essence a tragedy, and that
no sleight of hand or force of hand could give it even a tolerable show
of coherence or consistency when clipped and docked of its proper and
rightful end, the mere tone of style prevalent throughout all its better
parts to the absolute exclusion of any other would of itself most amply
suffice to show.&nbsp; Almost all that is here worthy of Shakespeare
at any time is worthy of Shakespeare at his highest: and of this every
touch, every line, every incident, every syllable, belongs to pure and
simple tragedy.&nbsp; The evasion of a tragic end by the invention and
intromission of Mariana has deserved and received high praise for its
ingenuity but ingenious evasion of a natural and proper end is usually
the distinctive quality which denotes a workman of a very much lower
school than the school of Shakespeare.&nbsp; In short and in fact, the
whole elaborate machinery by which the complete and completely unsatisfactory
result of the whole plot is attained is so thoroughly worthy of such
a contriver as &ldquo;the old fantastical duke of dark corners&rdquo;
as to be in a moral sense, if I dare say what I think, very far from
thoroughly worthy of the wisest and mightiest mind that ever was informed
with the spirit or genius of creative poetry.</p>
<p>I have one more note to add in passing which touches simply on a
musical point in lyric verse; and from which I would therefore give
any biped who believes that ears &ldquo;should be long to measure Shakespeare&rdquo;
all timely warning to avert the length of his own.&nbsp; A very singular
question, and one to me unaccountable except by a supposition which
on charitable grounds I should be loth to entertain for a moment&mdash;namely,
that such ears are commoner than I would fain believe on heads externally
or ostensibly human,&mdash;has been raised with regard to the first
immortal song of Mariana in the moated grange.&nbsp; This question is
whether the second verse appended by Fletcher to that divine Shakespearean
fragment may not haply have been written by the author of the first.&nbsp;
The visible and audible evidence that it cannot is of a kind which must
at once leap into sight of all human eyes and conviction of all human
ears.&nbsp; The metre of Shakespeare&rsquo;s verse, as written by Shakespeare,
is not the metre of Fletcher&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It can only seem the same
to those who hear by finger and not by ear: a class now at all events
but too evidently numerous enough to refute Sir Hugh&rsquo;s antiquated
objection to the once apparently tautologous phrase of Pistol. <a name="citation205"></a><a href="#footnote205">{205}</a></p>
<p>It is of course inexplicable, but it is equally of course undeniable,
that the mention of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Pericles</i> would seem immediately
and invariably to recall to a virtuous critical public of nice and nasty
mind the prose portions of the fourth act, the whole of the prose portions
of the fourth act, and nothing but the prose portions of the fourth
act.&nbsp; To readers and writers of books who readily admit their ineligibility
as members of a Society for the Suppression of Shakespeare or Rabelais,
of Homer or the Bible, it will seem that the third and fifth acts of
this ill-fated and ill-famed play, and with them the poetical parts
of the fourth act, are composed of metal incomparably more attractive.&nbsp;
But the virtuous critic, after the alleged nature of the vulturine kind,
would appear to have eyes and ears and nose for nothing else.&nbsp;
It is true that somewhat more of humour, touched once and again with
subtler hints of deeper truth, is woven into the too realistic weft
of these too lifelike scenes than into any of the corresponding parts
in <i>Measure for Measure</i> or in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>; true
also that in the hands of imitators, in hands so much weaker than Shakespeare&rsquo;s
as were Heywood&rsquo;s or Davenport&rsquo;s (who transplanted this
unlovely episode from <i>Pericles</i> into a play of his own), these
very scenes or such as they reappear unredeemed by any such relief in
all the rank and rampant ugliness of their raw repulsive realism: true,
again, that Fletcher has once equalled them in audacity, while stripping
off the nakedness of his subject the last ragged and rude pretence at
a moral purpose, and investing it instead with his very brightest robe
of gay parti-coloured humour: but after all it remains equally true
that to senses less susceptible of attraction by carrion than belong
to the vultures of critical and professional virtue they must always
remain as they have always been, something very considerably more than
unattractive.&nbsp; I at least for one must confess myself insufficiently
virtuous to have ever at any time for any moment felt towards them the
very slightest touch of any feeling more attractive than repulsion.&nbsp;
And herewith I hasten to wash my hands of the only unattractive matter
in the only three of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays which offer any such
matter to the perceptions of any healthy-minded and reasonable human
creature.</p>
<p>But what now shall I say that may not be too pitifully unworthy of
the glories and the beauties, the unsurpassable pathos and sublimity
inwoven with the imperial texture of this very play? the blood-red Tyrian
purple of tragic maternal jealousy which might seem to array it in a
worthy attire of its Tyrian name; the flower-soft loveliness of maiden
lamentation over the flower-strewn seaside grave of Marina&rsquo;s old
sea-tossed nurse, where I am unvirtuous enough (as virtue goes among
moralists) to feel more at home and better at ease than in the atmosphere
of her later lodging in Mitylene?&nbsp; What, above all, shall be said
of that storm above all storms ever raised in poetry, which ushered
into a world of such wonders and strange chances the daughter of the
wave-worn and world-wandering prince of Tyre?&nbsp; Nothing but this
perhaps, that it stands&mdash;or rather let me say that it blows and
sounds and shines and rings and thunders and lightens as far ahead of
all others as the burlesque sea-storm of Rabelais beyond all possible
storms of comedy.&nbsp; The recent compiler of a most admirably skilful
and most delicately invaluable compendium of Pantagruel or manual by
way of guidebook to Rabelais has but too justly taken note of the irrefragable
evidence there given that the one prose humourist who is to Aristophanes
as the human twin-star Castor to Pollux the divine can never have practically
weathered an actual gale; but if I may speak from a single experience
of one which a witness long inured to Indian storm as well as Indian
battle had never seen matched out of the tropics if ever overmatched
within them, I should venture to say, were the poet in question any
other mortal man than Shakespeare, to whom all things were better known
by instinct than ever they can be to others by experience, that the
painter of the storm in <i>Pericles</i> must have shared the adventure
and relished the rapture of such an hour.&nbsp; None other most assuredly
than himself alone could have mingled with the material passion of the
elements such human passion of pathos as thrills in such tenderly sublime
undertone of an agony so nobly subdued through the lament of Pericles
over Thaisa.&nbsp; As in his opening speech of this scene we heard all
the clangour and resonance of warring wind and sea, so now we hear a
sound of sacred and spiritual music as solemn as the central monochord
of the inner main itself.</p>
<p>That the three last acts of <i>Pericles</i>, with the possible if
not over probable exception of the so-called Chorus, <a name="citation210"></a><a href="#footnote210">{210}</a>
are wholly the work of Shakespeare in the ripest fullness of his latter
genius, is a position which needs exactly as much proof as does his
single-handed authorship of <i>Hamlet, Lear, Macbeth</i>, and <i>Othello</i>.&nbsp;
In the fifth act is a remarkable instance of a thing remarkably rare
with him; the recast or repetition in an improved and reinvigorated
form of a beautiful image or passage occurring in a previous play.&nbsp;
The now only too famous metaphor of &ldquo;patience on a monument smiling
at grief&rdquo;&mdash;too famous we might call it for its own fame&mdash;is
transfigured as from human beauty to divine, in its transformation to
the comparison of Marina&rsquo;s look with that of &ldquo;Patience gazing
on kings&rsquo; graves, and smiling Extremity out of act.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A precisely similar parallel is one to which I have referred elsewhere;
that between the two passages respectively setting forth the reciprocal
love of Helena and Hermia, of Emilia and Flavina.&nbsp; The change of
style and spirit in either case of reiteration is the change from a
simpler to a sublimer form of beauty.</p>
<p>In the two first acts of <i>Pericles</i> there are faint and rare
but evident and positive traces of a passing touch from the hasty hand
of Shakespeare: even here too we may say after Dido:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Nec tam aversus equos Tyri&acirc; sol jungit ab urbe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been said that those most unmistakable verses on &ldquo;the
blind mole&rdquo; are not such as any man could insert into another
man&rsquo;s work, or slip in between the lines of an inferior poet:
and that they occur naturally enough in a speech of no particular excellence.&nbsp;
I take leave decisively to question the former assertion, and flatly
to contradict the latter.&nbsp; The pathetic and magnificent lines in
dispute do not occur naturally enough, or at all naturally, among the
very poor, flat, creeping verses between which they have been thrust
with such over freehanded recklessness.&nbsp; No purple patch was ever
more pitifully out of place.&nbsp; There is indeed no second example
of such wanton and wayward liberality; but the generally lean and barren
style of these opening acts does not crawl throughout on exactly the
same low level.</p>
<p>The last of the only three plays with which I venture to find any
fault on the score of moral taste is the first on my list of the only
three plays belonging to this last period on which, as they now stand,
I trace the indisputable track of another touch than Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
But in the two cases remaining our general task of distinction should
on the whole be simple and easy enough for the veriest babes and sucklings
in the lower school of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>That the two great posthumous fragments we possess of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
uncompleted work are incomplete simply because the labour spent on either
was cut short by his timeless death is the first natural assumption
of any student with an eye quick enough to catch the point where the
traces of his hand break off; but I should now be inclined to guess
rather that on reconsideration of the subjects chosen he had rejected
or dismissed them for a time at least as unfit for dramatic handling.&nbsp;
It could have needed no great expenditure of reasoning or reflection
to convince a man of lesser mind and less experience than Shakespeare&rsquo;s
that no subject could possibly be more unmanageable, more indomitably
improper for such a purpose, than he had selected in <i>Timon of Athens</i>.&nbsp;
How he came ever to fall across such a subject, to hit upon such a choice,
we can spend no profitable time or pains in trying to conjecture.&nbsp;
It is clear, however, that at all events there was a season when the
inexplicable attraction of it was too strong for him to resist the singular
temptation to embody in palpable form, to array in dramatic raiment,
to invest with imaginative magnificence, the godless ascetic passion
of misanthropy, the martyrdom of an atheistic Stylites.&nbsp; Timon
is doubtless a man of far nobler type than any monomaniac of the tribe
of Macarius: but his immeasurable superiority in spiritual rank to the
hermit fathers of the desert serves merely to make him a thought madder
and a grain more miserable than the whole Thebaid of Christomaniacs
rolled into one.&nbsp; Foolish and fruitless as it has ever been to
hunt through Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays and sonnets on the false scent
of a fantastic trail, to put thaumaturgic trust in a dark dream of tracking
his untraceable personality through labyrinthine byways of life and
visionary crossroads of character, it is yet surely no blind assumption
to accept the plain evidence in both so patent before us, that he too
like other men had his dark seasons of outer or of inner life, and like
other poets found them or made them fruitful as well as bitter, though
it might be but of bitter fruit.&nbsp; And of such there is here enough
to glut the gorge of all the monks in monkery, or strengthen for a forty
days&rsquo; fast any brutallest unwashed theomaniac of the Thebaid.&nbsp;
The most unconscionably unclean of all foul-minded fanatics might have
been satisfied with the application to all women from his mother upwards
of the monstrous and magnificent obloquy found by Timon as insufficient
to overwhelm as his gold was inadequate to satisfy one insatiable and
indomitable &ldquo;brace of harlots.&rdquo;&nbsp; In <i>Troilus and
Cressida</i> we found too much that Swift might have written when half
inspired by the genius of Shakespeare; in the great and terrible fourth
act of <i>Timon</i> we find such tragedy as Juvenal might have written
when half deified by the spirit of &AElig;schylus.</p>
<p>There is a noticeable difference between the case of <i>Timon</i>
and the two other cases (diverse enough between themselves) of late
or mature work but partially assignable to the hand of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
In <i>Pericles</i> we may know exactly how much was added by Shakespeare
to the work of we know not whom; in <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i> we
can tell sometimes to a hair&rsquo;s breadth in a hemistich by whom
how much was added to the posthumous text of Shakespeare; in <i>Timon</i>
we cannot assert with the same confidence in the same accuracy that
just so many scenes and no more, just so many speeches and none other,
were the work of Shakespeare&rsquo;s or of some other hand.&nbsp; Throughout
the first act his presence lightens on us by flashes, as his voice peals
out by fits, from behind or above the too meanly decorated altar of
tragic or satiric song: in the second it is more sensibly continuous;
in the third it is all but utterly eclipsed; in the fourth it is but
very rarely intercepted for a very brief interval in the dark divine
service of a darker Commination Day: in the fifth it predominates generally
over the sullen and brooding atmosphere with the fierce imperious glare
of a &ldquo;bloody sun&rdquo; like that which the wasting shipmen watched
at noon &ldquo;in a hot and copper sky.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is here no
more to say of a poem inspired at once by the triune Furies of Ezekiel,
of Juvenal, and of Dante.</p>
<p>I can imagine no reason but that already suggested why Shakespeare
should in a double sense have taken Chaucer for his model or example
in leaving half told a story which he had borrowed from the father and
master of our narrative poetry.&nbsp; Among all competent scholars and
all rational students of Shakespeare there can have been, except possibly
with regard to three of the shorter scenes, no room for doubt or perplexity
on any detail of the subject since the perfect summary and the masterly
decision of Mr. Dyce.&nbsp; These three scenes, as no such reader will
need to be told or reminded, are the two first soliloquies of the Gaoler&rsquo;s
Daughter after the release of Palamon, and the scene of the portraits,
as we may in a double sense call it, in which Emilia, after weighing
against each other in solitude the likenesses of the cousins, receives
from her own kinsfolk a full and laboured description of their leading
champions on either side.&nbsp; Even setting apart for once and for
a moment the sovereign evidence of mere style, we must recognise in
this last instance a beautiful and significant example of that loyal
and loving fidelity to the minor passing suggestions of Chaucer&rsquo;s
text which on all possible occasions of such comparison so markedly
and vividly distinguishes the work of Shakespeare&rsquo;s from the work
of Fletcher&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Of the pestilent abuse and perversion
to which Fletcher has put the perhaps already superfluous hints or sketches
by Shakespeare for an episodical underplot, in his transmutation of
Palamon&rsquo;s love-stricken and luckless deliverer into the disgusting
burlesque of a mock Ophelia, I have happily no need as I should certainly
have no patience to speak. <a name="citation217"></a><a href="#footnote217">{217}</a></p>
<p>After the always immitigable gloom of <i>Timon</i> and the sometimes
malodorous exhalations of the three preceding plays, it is nothing less
than &ldquo;very heaven&rdquo; to find and feel ourselves again in the
midmost Paradise, the central Eden, of Shakespeare&rsquo;s divine discovery&mdash;of
his last sweet living invention.&nbsp; Here again is air as pure blowing
over fields as fragrant as where Dante saw Matilda or Milton saw Proserpine
gathering each as deathless flowers.&nbsp; We still have here to disentwine
or disentangle his own from the weeds of glorious and of other than
glorious feature with which Fletcher has thought fit to interweave them;
even in the close of the last scene of all we can say to a line, to
a letter, where Shakespeare ends and Fletcher begins.&nbsp; That scene
is opened by Shakespeare in his most majestic vein of meditative or
moral verse, pointed and coloured as usual with him alone by direct
and absolute aptitude to the immediate sentiment and situation of the
speaker and of no man else: then either Fletcher strikes in for a moment
with a touch of somewhat more Shakespearean tone than usual, or possibly
we have a survival of some lines&rsquo; length, not unretouched by Fletcher,
from Shakespeare&rsquo;s first sketch for a conclusion of the somewhat
calamitous and cumbrous underplot, which in any case was ultimately
left for Fletcher to expand into such a shape and bring by such means
to such an end as we may safely swear that Shakespeare would never have
admitted: then with the entrance and ensuing narrative of Pirithous
we have none but Shakespeare before us again, though it be Shakespeare
undoubtedly in the rough, and not as he might have chosen to present
himself after due revision, with rejection (we may well suppose) of
this point and readjustment of that: then upon the arrival of the dying
Arcite with his escort there follows a grievous little gap, a flaw but
pitifully patched by Fletcher, whom we recognise at wellnigh his worst
and weakest in Palamon&rsquo;s appeal to his kinsman for a last word,
&ldquo;if his heart, <i>his worthy, manly heart</i>&rdquo; (an exact
and typical example of Fletcher&rsquo;s tragically prosaic and prosaically
tragic dash of incurable commonplace), &ldquo;be yet unbroken,&rdquo;
and in the flaccid and futile answer which fails so signally to supply
the place of the most famous and pathetic passage in all the masterpiece
of Chaucer; a passage to which even Shakespeare could have added but
some depth and grandeur of his own giving, since neither he nor Dante&rsquo;s
very self nor any other among the divinest of men could have done more
or better than match it for tender and pure simplicity of words more
&ldquo;dearly sweet and bitter&rdquo; than the bitterest or the sweetest
of men&rsquo;s tears.&nbsp; Then, after the duly and properly conventional
engagement on the parts of Palamon and Emilia respectively to devote
the anniversary &ldquo;to tears&rdquo; and &ldquo;to honour,&rdquo;
the deeper note returns for one grand last time, grave at once and sudden
and sweet as the full choral opening of an anthem: the note which none
could ever catch of Shakespeare&rsquo;s very voice gives out the peculiar
cadence that it alone can give in the modulated instinct of a solemn
change or shifting of the metrical emphasis or <i>ictus</i> from one
to the other of two repeated words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nought could buy<br />
Dear love; but loss of dear love!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a touch beyond the ear or the hand of Fletcher: a chord sounded
from Apollo&rsquo;s own harp after a somewhat hoarse and reedy wheeze
from the scrannel-pipe of a lesser player than Pan.&nbsp; Last of all,
in words worthy to be the latest left of Shakespeare&rsquo;s, his great
and gentle Theseus winds up the heavenly harmonies of his last beloved
great poem.</p>
<p>And now, coming at length within the very circle of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
culminant and crowning constellation, bathing my whole soul and spirit
for the last and (if I live long enough) as surely for the first of
many thousand times in the splendours of the planet whose glory is the
light of his very love itself, standing even as Dante</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
the clear<br />
Amorous silence of the Swooning-sphere,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>what shall I say of thanksgiving before the final feast of Shakespeare?</p>
<p>The grace must surely be short enough if it would at all be gracious.&nbsp;
Even were Shakespeare&rsquo;s self alive again, or he now but fifteen
years since gone home to Shakespeare, <a name="citation220"></a><a href="#footnote220">{220}</a>
of whom Charles Lamb said well that none could have written his book
about Shakespeare but either himself alone or else he of whom the book
was written, yet could we not hope that either would have any new thing
to tell us of the <i>Tempest</i>, the <i>Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i>, and
<i>Cymbeline</i>.&nbsp; And for ourselves, what else could we do but
only ring changes on the word beautiful as Celia on the word wonderful
in her laughing litany of love? or what better or what more can we do
than in the deepest and most heartfelt sense of an old conventional
phrase, thank God and Shakespeare? for how to praise either for such
a gift of gifts we know not, knowing only and surely that none will
know for ever.</p>
<p>True or false, and it would now seem something less than likely to
be true, the fancy which assumed the last lines spoken by Prospero to
be likewise the last words of the last completed work of Shakespeare
was equally in either case at once natural and graceful.&nbsp; There
is but one figure sweeter than Miranda&rsquo;s and sublimer than Prospero&rsquo;s
in all the range of heaven on which the passion of our eyes could rest
at parting.&nbsp; And from one point of view there is even a more heavenly
quality perceptible in the light of this than of its two twin stars.&nbsp;
In no nook or corner of the island as we leave it is any savour left
or any memory lingering of any inexpiable evil.&nbsp; Alonzo is absolved;
even Antonio and Sebastian have made no such ineffaceable mark on it
by the presence of their pardoned crimes as is made by those which cost
the life of Mamillius and the labours of Imogen.&nbsp; Poor Caliban
is left in such comfort as may be allowed him by divine grace in the
favourable aspect of Setebos; and his comrades go by us &ldquo;reeling
ripe&rdquo; and &ldquo;gilded&rdquo; not by &ldquo;grand liquor&rdquo;
only but also by the summer lightning of men&rsquo;s laughter: blown
softly out of our sight, with a sound and a gust of music, by the breath
of the song of Ariel.</p>
<p>The wild wind of the <i>Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i> at its opening would
seem to blow us back into a wintrier world indeed.&nbsp; And to the
very end I must confess that I have in me so much of the spirit of Rachel
weeping in Ramah as will not be comforted because Mamillius is not.&nbsp;
It is well for those whose hearts are light enough, to take perfect
comfort even in the substitution of his sister Perdita for the boy who
died of &ldquo;thoughts high for one so tender.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even the
beautiful suggestion that Shakespeare as he wrote had in mind his own
dead little son still fresh and living at his heart can hardly add more
than a touch of additional tenderness to our perfect and piteous delight
in him.&nbsp; And even in her daughter&rsquo;s embrace it seems hard
if his mother should have utterly forgotten the little voice that had
only time to tell her just eight words of that ghost story which neither
she nor we were ever to hear ended.&nbsp; Any one but Shakespeare would
have sought to make pathetic profit out of the child by the easy means
of showing him if but once again as changed and stricken to the death
for want of his mother and fear for her and hunger and thirst at his
little high heart for the sight and touch of her: Shakespeare only could
find a better way, a subtler and a deeper chord to strike, by giving
us our last glimpse of him as he laughed and chattered with her &ldquo;past
enduring,&rdquo; to the shameful neglect of those ladies in the natural
blueness of whose eyebrows as well as their noses he so stoutly declined
to believe.&nbsp; And at the very end (as aforesaid) it may be that
we remember him all the better because the father whose jealousy killed
him and the mother for love of whom he died would seem to have forgotten
the little brave sweet spirit with all its truth of love and tender
sense of shame as perfectly and unpardonably as Shakespeare himself
at the close of <i>King Lear</i> would seem to have forgotten one who
never had forgotten Cordelia.</p>
<p>But yet&mdash;and here for once the phrase abhorred by Cleopatra
does not &ldquo;allay the good&rdquo; but only the bad &ldquo;precedence&rdquo;&mdash;if
ever amends could be made for such unnatural show of seeming forgetfulness
(&ldquo;out on the seeming!&nbsp; I will write against it&rdquo;&mdash;or
would, had I not written enough already), the poet most assuredly has
made such amends here.&nbsp; At the sunrise of Perdita beside Florizel
it seems as if the snows of sixteen winters had melted all together
into the splendour of one unutterable spring.&nbsp; They &ldquo;smell
April and May&rdquo; in a sweeter sense than it could be said of &ldquo;young
Master Fenton&rdquo;: &ldquo;nay, which is more,&rdquo; as his friend
and champion Mistress Quickly might have added to mine host&rsquo;s
commendatory remark, they speak all April and May; because April is
in him as naturally as May in her, by just so many years&rsquo; difference
before the Mayday of her birth as went to make up her dead brother&rsquo;s
little lot of living breath, which in Beaumont&rsquo;s most lovely and
Shakespeare-worthy phrase &ldquo;was not a life; was but a piece of
childhood thrown away.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor can I be content to find no
word of old affection for Autolycus, who lived, as we may not doubt,
though but a hint or promise be vouchsafed us for all assurance that
he lived by favour of his &ldquo;good masters&rdquo; once more to serve
Prince Florizel and wear three-pile for as much of his time as it might
please him to put on &ldquo;robes&rdquo; like theirs that were &ldquo;gentlemen
born,&rdquo; and had &ldquo;been so any time these four hours.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And yet another and a graver word must be given with all reverence to
the &ldquo;grave and good Paulina,&rdquo; whose glorious fire of godlike
indignation was as warmth and cordial to the innermost heart while yet
bruised and wrung for the yet fresh loss of Mamillius.</p>
<p>The time is wellnigh come now for me to consecrate in this book my
good will if not good work to the threefold and thrice happy memory
of the three who have written of Shakespeare as never man wrote, nor
ever man may write again; to the everlasting praise and honour and glory
of Charles Lamb, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Walter Savage Landor;
&ldquo;wishing,&rdquo; I hardly dare to say, &ldquo;what I write may
be read by their light.&rdquo;&nbsp; The play of plays, which is <i>Cymbeline</i>,
remains alone to receive the last salute of all my love.</p>
<p>I think, as far as I can tell, I may say I have always loved this
one beyond all other children of Shakespeare.&nbsp; The too literal
egoism of this profession will not be attributed by any candid or even
commonly honest reader to the violence of vanity so much more than comical
as to make me suppose that such a record or assurance could in itself
be matter of interest to any man: but simply to the real and simple
reason, that I wish to show cause for my choice of this work to wind
up with, beyond the mere chance of its position at the close of the
chaotically inconsequent catalogue of contents affixed to the first
edition.&nbsp; In this casualty&mdash;for no good thing can reasonably
be ascribed to design on the part of the first editors&mdash;there would
seem to be something more than usual of what we may call, if it so please
us, a happy providence.&nbsp; It is certain that no studious arrangement
could possibly have brought the book to a happier end.&nbsp; Here is
depth enough with height enough of tragic beauty and passion, terror
and love and pity, to approve the presence of the most tragic Master&rsquo;s
hand; subtlety enough of sweet and bitter truth to attest the passage
of the mightiest and wisest scholar or teacher in the school of the
human spirit; beauty with delight enough and glory of life and grace
of nature to proclaim the advent of the one omnipotent Maker among all
who bear that name.&nbsp; Here above all is the most heavenly triad
of human figures that ever even Shakespeare brought together; a diviner
three, as it were a living god-garland of the noblest earth-born brothers
and loveworthiest heaven-born sister, than the very givers of all grace
and happiness to their Grecian worshippers of old time over long before.&nbsp;
The passion of Posthumus is noble, and potent the poison of Iachimo;
Cymbeline has enough for Shakespeare&rsquo;s present purpose of &ldquo;the
king-becoming graces&rdquo;; but we think first and last of her who
was &ldquo;truest speaker&rdquo; and those who &ldquo;called her brother,
when she was but their sister; she them brothers, when they were so
indeed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The very crown and flower of all her father&rsquo;s
daughters,&mdash;I do not speak here of her human father, but her divine&mdash;the
woman above all Shakespeare&rsquo;s women is Imogen.&nbsp; As in Cleopatra
we found the incarnate sex, the woman everlasting, so in Imogen we find
half glorified already the immortal godhead of womanhood.&nbsp; I would
fain have some honey in my words at parting&mdash;with Shakespeare never,
but for ever with these notes on Shakespeare; and I am therefore something
more than fain to close my book upon the name of the woman best beloved
in all the world of song and all the tide of time; upon the name of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Imogen.</p>
<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>
<h3>NOTE ON THE HISTORICAL PLAY OF KING EDWARD III.<br />
1879.</h3>
<p>The epitaph of German criticism on Shakespeare was long since written
by the unconscious hand which penned the following sentence; an inscription
worthy of perpetual record on the registers of Gotham or in the daybook
of the yet unstranded Ship of Fools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Thomas Lord Cromwell:&mdash;Sir John Oldcastle:&mdash;A
Yorkshire Tragedy</i>.&mdash;The three last pieces are not only unquestionably
Shakespeare&rsquo;s, but in my opinion they deserve to be classed among
his best and maturest works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This memorable opinion is the verdict of the modest and judicious
Herr von Schlegel: who had likewise in his day the condescension to
inform our ignorance of the melancholy fact so strangely overlooked
by the contemporaries of Christopher Marlowe, that &ldquo;his verses
are flowing, but without energy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Strange, but true; too
strange, we may reasonably infer, not to be true.&nbsp; Only to German
eyes has the treasure-house of English poetry ever disclosed a secret
of this kind: to German ears alone has such discord or default been
ever perceptible in its harmonies.</p>
<p>Now the facts with regard to this triad of plays are briefly these.&nbsp;
<i>Thomas Lord Cromwell</i> is a piece of such utterly shapeless, spiritless,
bodiless, soulless, senseless, helpless, worthless rubbish, that there
is no known writer of Shakespeare&rsquo;s age to whom it could be ascribed
without the infliction of an unwarrantable insult on that writer&rsquo;s
memory.&nbsp; <i>Sir John Oldcastle</i> is the compound piecework of
four minor playwrights, one of them afterwards and otherwise eminent
as a poet&mdash;Munday, Drayton, Wilson, and Hathaway: a thin sample
of poetic patchery cobbled up and stitched together so as to serve its
hour for a season without falling to pieces at the first touch.&nbsp;
The <i>Yorkshire Tragedy</i> is a coarse, crude, and vigorous impromptu,
in which we possibly might almost think it possible that Shakespeare
had a hand (or at least a finger), if we had any reason to suppose that
during the last ten or twelve years of his life <a name="citation232"></a><a href="#footnote232">{232}</a>
he was likely to have taken part in any such dramatic improvisation.</p>
<p>The example and the exposure of Schlegel&rsquo;s misadventures in
this line have not sufficed to warn off minor blunderers from treading
with emulous confidence &ldquo;through forthrights and meanders&rdquo;
in the very muddiest of their precursor&rsquo;s traces.&nbsp; We may
notice, for one example, the revival&mdash;or at least the discussion
as of something worth serious notice&mdash;of a wellnigh still-born
theory, first dropped in a modest corner of the critical world exactly
a hundred and seventeen years ago.&nbsp; Its parent, notwithstanding
this perhaps venial indiscretion, was apparently an honest and modest
gentleman; and the play itself, which this ingenuous theorist was fain,
with all diffidence, to try whether haply he might be permitted to foist
on the apocryphal fatherhood of Shakespeare, is not without such minor
merits as may excuse us for wasting a few minutes on examination of
the theory which seeks to confer on it the factitious and artificial
attraction of a spurious and adventitious interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Raigne of King Edward the third: As it hath bin sundrie
times plaied about the Citie of London,&rdquo; was published in 1596,
and ran through two or three anonymous editions before the date of the
generation was out which first produced it.&nbsp; Having thus run to
the end of its natural tether, it fell as naturally into the oblivion
which has devoured, and has not again disgorged, so many a more precious
production of its period.&nbsp; In 1760 it was reprinted in the &ldquo;Prolusions&rdquo;
of Edward Capell, whose text is now before me.&nbsp; This editor was
the first mortal to suggest that his newly unearthed treasure might
possibly be a windfall from the topless tree of Shakespeare.&nbsp; Being,
as I have said, a duly modest and an evidently honest man, he admits
&ldquo;with candour&rdquo; that there is no jot or tittle of &ldquo;external
evidence&rdquo; whatsoever to be alleged in support of this gratuitous
attribution: but he submits, with some fair show of reason, that there
is a certain &ldquo;resemblance between the style of&rdquo; Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&ldquo;earlier performances and of the work in question&rdquo;; and
without the slightest show of any reason whatever he appends to this
humble and plausible plea the unspeakably unhappy assertion that at
the time of its appearance &ldquo;there was no known writer equal to
such a play&rdquo;; whereas at a moderate computation there were, I
should say, on the authority of Henslowe&rsquo;s Diary, at least a dozen&mdash;and
not improbably a score.&nbsp; In any case there was one then newly dead,
too long before his time, whose memory stands even higher above the
possible ascription of such a work than that of the adolescent Shakespeare&rsquo;s
very self.</p>
<p>Of one point we may be sure, even where so much is unsure as we find
it here: in the curt atheological phrase of the Persian Lucretius, &ldquo;one
thing is certain, and the rest is lies.&rdquo;&nbsp; The author of <i>King
Edward III</i>. was a devout student and a humble follower of Christopher
Marlowe, not yet wholly disengaged by that august and beneficent influence
from all attraction towards the &ldquo;jigging veins of rhyming mother-wits&rdquo;;
and fitter on the whole to follow this easier and earlier vein of writing,
half lyrical in manner and half elegiac, than to brace upon his punier
limbs the young giant&rsquo;s newly fashioned buskin of blank verse.&nbsp;
The signs of this growing struggle, the traces of this incomplete emancipation,
are perceptible throughout in the alternate prevalence of two conflicting
and irreconcilable styles; which yet affords no evidence or suggestion
of a double authorship.&nbsp; For the intelligence which moulds and
informs the whole work, the spirit which pervades and imbues the general
design, is of a piece, so to speak, throughout; a point imperceptible
to the eye, a touchstone intangible by the finger, alike of a scholiast
and a dunce.</p>
<p>Another test, no less unmistakable by the student and no less indiscernible
to the sciolist, is this: that whatever may be the demerits of this
play, they are due to no voluntary or involuntary carelessness or haste.&nbsp;
Here is not the swift impatient journeywork of a rough and ready hand;
here is no sign of such compulsory hurry in the discharge of a task
something less than welcome, if not of an imposition something less
than tolerable, as we may rationally believe ourselves able to trace
in great part of Marlowe&rsquo;s work: in the latter half of <i>The
Jew of Malta</i>, in the burlesque interludes of <i>Doctor Faustus</i>,
and wellnigh throughout the whole scheme and course of <i>The Massacre
at Paris</i>.&nbsp; Whatever in <i>King Edward III</i>. is mediocre
or worse is evidently such as it is through no passionate or slovenly
precipitation of handiwork, but through pure incompetence to do better.&nbsp;
The blame of the failure, the shame of the shortcoming, cannot be laid
to the account of any momentary excess or default in emotion, of passing
exhaustion or excitement, of intermittent impulse and reaction; it is
an indication of lifelong and irremediable impotence.&nbsp; And it is
further to be noted that by far the least unsuccessful parts of the
play are also by far the most unimportant.&nbsp; The capacity of the
author seems to shrink and swell alternately, to erect its plumes and
deject them, to contract and to dilate the range and orbit of its flight
in a steadily inverse degree to the proportionate interest of the subject
or worth of the topic in hand.&nbsp; There could be no surer proof that
it is neither the early nor the hasty work of a great or even a remarkable
poet.&nbsp; It is the best that could be done at any time by a conscientious
and studious workman of technically insufficient culture and of naturally
limited means.</p>
<p>I would not, however, be supposed to undervalue the genuine and graceful
ability of execution displayed by the author at his best.&nbsp; He could
write at times very much after the earliest fashion of the adolescent
Shakespeare; in other words, after the fashion of the day or hour, to
which in some degree the greatest writer of that hour or that day cannot
choose but conform at starting, and the smallest writer must needs conform
for ever.&nbsp; By the rule which would attribute to Shakespeare every
line written in his first manner which appeared during the first years
of his poetic progress, it is hard to say what amount of bad verse or
better, current during the rise and the reign of their several influences,&mdash;for
this kind of echo or of copywork, consciously or unconsciously repercussive
and reflective, begins with the very first audible sound of a man&rsquo;s
voice in song, with the very first noticeable stroke of his hand in
painting&mdash;it is hard to say what amount of tolerable or intolerable
work might not or may not be assignable by scholiasts of the future
to Byron or to Shelley, to Mr. Tennyson or to Mr. Browning.&nbsp; A
time by this rule might come&mdash;but I am fain to think better of
the Fates&mdash;when by comparison of detached words and collation of
dismembered phrases the memory of Mr. Tennyson would be weighted and
degraded by the ascription of whole volumes of pilfered and diluted
verse now current&mdash;if not yet submerged&mdash;under the name or
the pseudonym of the present <a name="citation237"></a><a href="#footnote237">{237}</a>
Viceroy&mdash;or Vice-empress is it?&mdash;of India.&nbsp; But the obvious
truth is this: the voice of Shakespeare&rsquo;s adolescence had as usual
an echo in it of other men&rsquo;s notes: I can remember the name of
but one poet whose voice from the beginning had none; who started with
a style of his own, though he may have chosen to annex&mdash;&ldquo;annex
the wise it call&rdquo;; <i>convey</i> is obsolete&mdash;to annex whole
phrases or whole verses at need, for the use or the ease of an idle
minute; and this name of course is Marlowe&rsquo;s.&nbsp; So starting,
Shakespeare had yet (like all other and lesser poets born) some perceptible
notes in his yet half boyish voice that were not borrowed; and these
were at once caught up and re-echoed by such fellow-pupils with Shakespeare
of the young Master of them all&mdash;such humbler and feebler disciples,
or simpler sheep (shall we call them?) of the great &ldquo;dead shepherd&rdquo;&mdash;as
the now indistinguishable author of <i>King Edward III</i>.</p>
<p>In the first scene of the first act the impotent imitation of Marlowe
is pitifully patent.&nbsp; Possibly there may also be an imitation of
the still imitative style of Shakespeare, and the style may be more
accurately definable as a copy of a copy&mdash;a study after the manner
of Marlowe, not at second hand, but at third.&nbsp; In any case, being
obviously too flat and feeble to show a touch of either godlike hand,
this scene may be set aside at once to make way for the second.</p>
<p>The second scene is more animated, but low in style till we come
to the outbreak of rhyme.&nbsp; In other words, the energetic or active
part is at best passable&mdash;fluent and decent commonplace: but where
the style turns undramatic and runs into mere elegiacs, a likeness becomes
perceptible to the first elegiac style of Shakespeare.&nbsp; Witness
these lines spoken by the King in contemplation of the Countess of Salisbury&rsquo;s
beauty, while yet struggling against the nascent motions of a base love:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Now in the sun alone it doth not lie<br />
With light to take light from a mortal eye:<br />
For here two day-stars that mine eyes would see<br />
More than the sun steal mine own light from me.<br />
Contemplative desire! desire to be<br />
In contemplation that may master thee!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Decipit exemplar vitiis imitabile</i>: if Shakespeare ever saw
or heard these pretty lines, he should have felt the unconscious rebuke
implied in such close and facile imitation of his own early elegiacs.&nbsp;
As a serious mimicry of his first manner, a critical parody summing
up in little space the sweet faults of his poetic nonage, with its barren
overgrowth of unprofitable flowers,&mdash;bright point, soft metaphor,
and sweet elaborate antithesis&mdash;this is as good of its kind as
anything between Aristophanes and Horace Smith.&nbsp; Indeed, it may
remind us of that parody on the soft, superfluous, flowery and frothy
style of Agathon, which at the opening of the <i>Thesmophoriazus&aelig;</i>
cannot but make the youngest and most ignorant reader laugh, though
the oldest and most learned has never set eyes on a line of the original
verses which supplied the incarnate god of comic song with matter for
such exquisite burlesque.</p>
<p>To the speech above cited the reply of the Countess is even gracefuller,
and closer to the same general model of fanciful elegiac dialogue:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Let not thy presence, like the April sun,<br />
Flatter our earth, and suddenly be done:<br />
More happy do not make our outward wall<br />
Than thou wilt grace our inward house withal.<br />
Our house, my liege, is like a country swain,<br />
Whose habit rude, and manners blunt and plain.<br />
Presageth naught; yet inly beautified<br />
With bounty&rsquo;s riches, and fair hidden pride;<br />
For where the golden ore doth buried lie,<br />
The ground, undecked with nature&rsquo;s tapestry,<br />
Seems barren, sere, unfertile, fruitless, dry;<br />
And where the upper turf of earth doth boast<br />
His pride, perfumes, <a name="citation239"></a><a href="#footnote239">{239}</a>
and particoloured cost,<br />
Delve there, and find this issue and their pride<br />
To spring from ordure and corruption&rsquo;s side.<br />
But, to make up my all too long compare,<br />
These ragged walls no testimony are<br />
What is within; but, like a cloak, doth hide<br />
From weather&rsquo;s waste the under garnished pride.<br />
More gracious than my terms can let thee be,<br />
Entreat thyself to stay awhile with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only the exquisite grace of this charming last couplet, but the
smooth sound strength, the fluency and clarity of the whole passage,
may serve to show that the original suggestion of Capell, if (as I think)
untenable, was not (we must admit) unpardonable.&nbsp; The very oversight
perceptible to any eye and painful to any ear not sealed up by stepdame
nature from all perception of pleasure or of pain derivable from good
verse or bad&mdash;the reckless reiteration of the same rhyme with but
one poor couplet intervening&mdash;suggests rather the oversight of
an unfledged poet than the obtuseness of a full-grown poeticule or poetaster.</p>
<p>But of how many among the servile or semi-servile throng of imitators
in every generation may not as much as this be said by tolerant or kindly
judges!&nbsp; Among the herd of such diminutives as swarm after the
heel or fawn upon the hand of Mr. Tennyson, more than one, more than
two or three, have come as close as his poor little viceregal or vice-imperial
parasite to the very touch and action of the master&rsquo;s hand which
feeds them unawares from his platter as they fawn; as close as this
nameless and short-winded satellite to the gesture and the stroke of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; For this also must be noted; that the resemblance
here is but of stray words, of single lines, of separable passages.&nbsp;
The whole tone of the text, the whole build of the play, the whole scheme
of the poem, is far enough from any such resemblance.&nbsp; The structure,
the composition, is feeble, incongruous, inadequate, effete.&nbsp; Any
student will remark at a first glance what a short-breathed runner,
what a broken-winded athlete in the lists of tragic verse, is the indiscoverable
author of this play.</p>
<p>There is another point which the Neo-Shakespearean synagogue will
by no man be expected to appreciate; for to apprehend it requires some
knowledge and some understanding of the poetry of the Shakespearean
age&mdash;so surely we now should call it, rather than Elizabethan or
Jacobean, for the sake of verbal convenience, if not for the sake of
literary decency; and such knowledge or understanding no sane man will
expect to find in any such quarter.&nbsp; Even in the broad coarse comedy
of the period we find here and there the same sweet and simple echoes
of the very cradle-song (so to call it) of our drama: so like Shakespeare,
they might say who knew nothing of Shakespeare&rsquo;s fellows, that
we cannot choose but recognise his hand.&nbsp; Here as always first
in the field&mdash;the genuine and golden harvest-field of Shakespearean
criticism, Charles Lamb has cited a passage from <i>Green&rsquo;s Tu
Quoque</i>&mdash;a comedy miserably misreprinted in Dodsley&rsquo;s
Old Plays&mdash;on which he observes that &ldquo;this is so like Shakespeare,
that we seem to remember it,&rdquo; being as it is a girl&rsquo;s gentle
lamentation over the selfish, exacting, suspicious and trustless love
of man, as contrasted with the swift simple surrender of a woman&rsquo;s
love at the first heartfelt appeal to her pity&mdash;&ldquo;we seem
to remember it,&rdquo; says Lamb, as a speech of Desdemona uttered on
a first perception or suspicion of jealousy or alienation in Othello.&nbsp;
This lovely passage, if I dare say so in contravention to the authority
of Lamb, is indeed as like the manner of Shakespeare as it can be&mdash;to
eyes ignorant of what his fellows can do; but it is not like the manner
of the Shakespeare who wrote <i>Othello</i>.&nbsp; This, however, is
beside the question.&nbsp; It is very like the Shakespeare who wrote
the <i>Comedy of Errors&mdash;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost&mdash;Romeo
and Juliet</i>.&nbsp; It is so like that had we fallen upon it in any
of these plays it would long since have been a household word in all
men&rsquo;s mouths for sweetness, truth, simplicity, perfect and instinctive
accuracy of touch.&nbsp; It is very much liker the first manner of Shakespeare
than any passage in <i>King Edward III</i>.&nbsp; And no Sham Shakespearean
critic that I know of has yet assigned to the hapless object of his
howling homage the authorship of <i>Green&rsquo;s Tu Quoque</i>.</p>
<p>Returning to our text, we find in the short speech of the King with
which the first act is wound up yet another couplet which has the very
ring in it of Shakespeare&rsquo;s early notes&mdash;the catch at words
rather than play on words which his tripping tongue in youth could never
resist:</p>
<blockquote><p>Countess, albeit my business urgeth me,<br />
It shall attend while I attend on thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And with this pretty little instance of courtly and courteous euphuism
we pass from the first to the second and most important act in the play.</p>
<p>Any reader well versed in the text of Shakespeare, and ill versed
in the work of his early rivals and his later pupils, might surely be
forgiven if on a first reading of the speech with which this act opens
he should cry out with Capell that here at least was the unformed hand
of the Master perceptible and verifiable indeed.&nbsp; The writer, he
might say, has the very glance of his eye, the very trick of his gait,
the very note of his accent.&nbsp; But on getting a little more knowledge,
such a reader will find the use of it in the perception to which he
will have attained that in his early plays, as in his two early poems,
the style of Shakespeare was not for the most part distinctively his
own.&nbsp; It was that of a crew, a knot of young writers, among whom
he found at once both leaders and followers to be guided and to guide.&nbsp;
A mere glance into the rich lyric literature of the period will suffice
to show the dullest eye and teach the densest ear how nearly innumerable
were the Englishmen of Elizabeth&rsquo;s time who could sing in the
courtly or pastoral key of the season, each man of them a few notes
of his own, simple or fantastic, but all sweet, clear, genuine of their
kind:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facies non omnibus
una,<br />
Nec diversa tamen:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and yet so close is the generic likeness between flower and flower
of the same lyrical garden that the first half of the quotation seems
but half applicable here.&nbsp; In Bird&rsquo;s, Morley&rsquo;s, Dowland&rsquo;s
collections of music with the words appended&mdash;in such jewelled
volumes as <i>England&rsquo;s Helicon</i> and <i>Davison&rsquo;s Poetical
Rhapsody</i>&mdash;their name is Legion, their numbers are numberless.&nbsp;
You cannot call them imitators, this man of that, or all of any; they
were all of one school, but it was a school without a master or a head.&nbsp;
And even so it was with the earliest sect or gathering of dramatic writers
in England.&nbsp; Marlowe alone stood apart and above them all&mdash;the
young Shakespeare among the rest; but among these we cannot count, we
cannot guess, how many were wellnigh as competent as he to continue
the fluent rhyme, to prolong the facile echo, of Greene and Peele, their
first and most famous leaders.</p>
<p>No more docile or capable pupil could have been desired by any master
in any art than the author of <i>David and Bethsabe</i> has found in
the writer of this second act.&nbsp; He has indeed surpassed his model,
if not in grace and sweetness, yet in taste or tact of expression, in
continuity and equality of style.&nbsp; Vigour is not the principal
note of his manner, but compared with the soft effusive ebullience of
his master&rsquo;s we may fairly call it vigorous and condensed.&nbsp;
But all this merit or demerit is matter of mere language only.&nbsp;
The poet&mdash;a very pretty poet in his way, and doubtless capable
of gracious work enough in the idyllic or elegiac line of business&mdash;shows
about as much capacity to grasp and handle the fine intimacies of character
and the large issues of circumstance to any tragic or dramatic purpose,
as might be expected from an idyllic or elegiac poet who should suddenly
assume the buskin of tragedy.&nbsp; Let us suppose that Moschus, for
example, on the strength of having written a sweeter elegy than ever
before was chanted over the untimely grave of a friend and fellow-singer,
had said within himself, &ldquo;Go to, I will be Sophocles&rdquo;; can
we imagine that the tragic result would have been other than tragical
indeed for the credit of his gentle name, and comical indeed for all
who might have envied the mild and modest excellence which fashion or
hypocrisy might for years have induced them to besprinkle with the froth
and slaver of their promiscuous and pointless adulation?</p>
<p>As the play is not more generally known than it deserves to be,&mdash;or
perhaps we may say it is somewhat less known, though its claim to general
notice is faint indeed compared with that of many a poem of its age
familiar only to special students in our own&mdash;I will transcribe
a few passages to show how far the writer could reach at his best; leaving
for others to indicate how far short of that not inaccessible point
he is too generally content to fall and to remain.</p>
<p>The opening speech is spoken by one Lodowick, a parasite of the King&rsquo;s;
who would appear, like Fran&ccedil;ois Villon under the roof of his
Fat Madge, to have succeeded in reconciling the professional duties&mdash;may
I not say, the generally discordant and discrepant offices?&mdash;of
a poet and a pimp.</p>
<blockquote><p>I might perceive his eye in her eye lost,<br />
His ear to drink her sweet tongue&rsquo;s utterance;<br />
And changing passion, like inconstant clouds,<br />
That, rackt upon the carriage of the winds,<br />
Increase, and die, in his disturb&egrave;d cheeks.<br />
Lo, when she blushed, even then did he look pale;<br />
As if her cheeks by some enchanted power<br />
Attracted had the cherry blood from his: <a name="citation245a"></a><a href="#footnote245a">{245a}</a><br />
Anon, with reverent fear when she grew pale,<br />
His cheeks put on their scarlet ornaments;<br />
But no more like her oriental red<br />
Than brick to coral, or live things to dead. <a name="citation245b"></a><a href="#footnote245b">{245b}</a><br />
Why did he then thus counterfeit her looks?<br />
If she did blush, &rsquo;twas tender modest shame,<br />
Being in the sacred presence of a king;<br />
If he did blush, &rsquo;twas red immodest shame<br />
To vail his eyes amiss, being a king;<br />
If she looked pale, &rsquo;twas silly woman&rsquo;s fear<br />
To bear herself in presence of a king;<br />
If he looked pale, it was with guilty fear<br />
To dote amiss, being a mighty king.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is better than the insufferable style of <i>Locrine</i>, which
is in great part made up of such rhymeless couplets, each tagged with
an empty verbal antithesis; but taken as a sample of dramatic writing,
it is but just better than what is utterly intolerable.&nbsp; Dogberry
has defined it exactly; it is most tolerable&mdash;and not to be endured.</p>
<p>The following speech of King Edward is in that better style of which
the author&rsquo;s two chief models were not at their best incapable
for awhile under the influence and guidance (we may suppose) of their
friend Marlowe.</p>
<blockquote><p>She is grown more fairer far since I came hither;<br />
Her voice more silver every word than other,<br />
Her wit more fluent.&nbsp; What a strange discourse<br />
Unfolded she of David and his Scots!<br />
<i>Even thus</i>, quoth she, <i>he spake</i>&mdash;and then spake broad,<br />
With epithets and accents of the Scot;<br />
But somewhat better than the Scot could speak:<br />
<i>And thus</i>, quoth she&mdash;and answered then herself;<br />
For who could speak like her? but she herself<br />
Breathes from the wall an angel&rsquo;s note from heaven<br />
Of sweet defiance to her barbarous foes.<br />
When she would talk of peace, methinks her tongue<br />
Commanded war to prison; <a name="citation246"></a><a href="#footnote246">{246}</a>
when of war,<br />
It wakened C&aelig;sar from his Roman grave<br />
To hear war beautified by her discourse.<br />
Wisdom is foolishness, but in her tongue;<br />
Beauty a slander, but in her fair face;<br />
There is no summer but in her cheerful looks,<br />
Nor frosty winter but in her disdain.<br />
I cannot blame the Scots that did besiege her,<br />
For she is all the treasure of our land;<br />
But call them cowards that they ran away,<br />
Having so rich and fair a cause to stay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if for a moment we may fancy that here and there we have caught
such an echo of Marlowe as may have fallen from the lips of Shakespeare
in his salad days, in his period of poetic pupilage, we have but a very
little way to go forward before we come upon indisputable proof that
the pupil was one of feebler hand and fainter voice than Shakespeare.&nbsp;
Let us take the passage on poetry, beginning&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, Lodowick, invocate <a name="citation247"></a><a href="#footnote247">{247}</a>
some golden Muse<br />
To bring thee hither an enchanted pen;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so forth.&nbsp; No scholar in English poetry but will recognise
at once the flat and futile imitation of Marlowe; not of his great general
style alone, but of one special and transcendant passage which can never
be too often quoted.</p>
<blockquote><p>If all the pens that ever poets held<br />
Had fed the feeling of their masters&rsquo; thoughts,<br />
And every sweetness that inspired their hearts,<br />
Their minds, and muses on admir&egrave;d themes;<br />
If all the heavenly quintessence they still<br />
From their immortal flowers of poesy,<br />
Wherein, as in a mirror, we perceive<br />
The highest reaches of a human wit;<br />
If these had made one poem&rsquo;s period,<br />
And all combined in beauty&rsquo;s worthiness,<br />
Yet should there hover in their restless heads<br />
One thought, one grace, one wonder, at the least,<br />
Which into words no virtue can digest. <a name="citation248"></a><a href="#footnote248">{248}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Infinite as is the distance between the long roll of these mighty
lines and the thin tinkle of their feeble imitator&rsquo;s, yet we cannot
choose but catch the ineffectual note of a would-be echo in the speech
of the King to his parasite&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>For so much moving hath a poet&rsquo;s pen, etc., etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is really not worth while to transcribe the poor meagre versicles
at length: but a glance at the text will show how much fitter was their
author to continue the tradition of Peele than to emulate the innovations
of Marlowe.&nbsp; In the speeches that follow there is much pretty verbiage
after the general manner of Elizabethan sonnetteers, touched here and
there with something of a higher tone; but the whole scene drags, flags,
halts onward at such a languid rate, that to pick out all the prettiest
lines by way of sample would give a favourable impression but too likely
to be reversed on further and fuller acquaintance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Forget not to set down, how passionate,<br />
How heart-sick, and how full of languishment,<br />
Her beauty makes me. . . . . .<br />
Write on, while I peruse her in my thoughts.<br />
Her voice to music, or the nightingale:<br />
To music every summer-leaping swain<br />
Compares his sunburnt lover when she speaks;<br />
And why should I speak of the nightingale?<br />
The nightingale sings of adulterate wrong;<br />
And that, compared, is too satirical:<br />
For sin, though sin, would not be so esteemed;<br />
But rather virtue sin, sin virtue deemed.<br />
Her hair, far softer than the silkworm&rsquo;s twist,<br />
Like as a flattering glass, doth make more fair<br />
The yellow amber:&mdash;<i>Like a flattering glass</i><br />
Comes in too soon; for, writing of her eyes,<br />
I&rsquo;ll say that like a glass they catch the sun,<br />
And thence the hot reflection doth rebound<br />
Against my breast, and burns the heart within.<br />
Ah, what a world of descant makes my soul<br />
Upon this voluntary ground of love!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty enough, very pretty! but&rdquo; exactly as like and
as near the style of Shakespeare&rsquo;s early plays as is the style
of Constable&rsquo;s sonnets to that of Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Unless
we are to assign to the Master every unaccredited song, sonnet, elegy,
tragedy, comedy, and farce of his period, which bears the same marks
of the same date&mdash;a date, like our own, of too prolific and imitative
production&mdash;as we find inscribed on the greater part of his own
early work; unless we are to carry even as far as this the audacity
and arrogance of our sciolism, we must somewhere make a halt&mdash;and
it must be on the near side of such an attribution as that of <i>King
Edward III</i>. to the hand of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>With the disappearance of the poetic pimp and the entrance of the
unsuspecting Countess, the style rises yet again&mdash;and really, this
time, much to the author&rsquo;s credit.&nbsp; It would need a very
fine touch from a very powerful hand to improve on the delicacy and
dexterity of the prelude or overture to the King&rsquo;s avowal of adulterous
love.&nbsp; But when all is said, though very delicate and very dexterous,
it is not forcible work: I do not mean by forcible the same as violent,
spasmodic, emphatic beyond the modesty of nature; a poet is of course
only to be commended, and that heartily, for keeping within this bound;
but he is not to be commended for coming short of it.&nbsp; This whole
scene is full of mild and temperate beauty, of fanciful yet earnest
simplicity; but the note of it, the expression, the dominant key of
the style, is less appropriate to the utterance of a deep and deadly
passion than&mdash;at the utmost&mdash;of what modern tongues might
call a strong and rather dangerous flirtation.&nbsp; Passion, so to
speak, is quite out of this writer&rsquo;s call; the depths and heights
of manly as of womanly emotion are alike beyond his reach.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,<br />
He turns to favour and to prettiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To favour and to prettiness&rdquo;; the definition of his
utmost merit and demerit, his final achievement and shortcoming, is
here complete and exact.&nbsp; Witness the sweet quiet example of idyllic
work which I extract from a scene beginning in the regular am&oelig;b&aelig;an
style of ancient pastoral.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; Thou hear&rsquo;st me say that I
do dote on thee.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp; If on my beauty, take it if thou canst;<br />
Though little, I do prize it ten times less:<br />
If on my virtue, take it if thou canst;<br />
For virtue&rsquo;s store by giving doth augment:<br />
Be it on what it will that I can give<br />
And thou canst take away, inherit it.</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; It is thy beauty that I would enjoy.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp; O, were it painted, I would wipe it off,<br />
And dispossess myself to give it thee:<br />
But, sovereign, it is soldered to my life;<br />
Take one and both; for like an humble shadow<br />
It haunts the sunshine of my summer&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; But thou mayst lend it me to sport withal.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp; As easy may my intellectual soul<br />
Be lent away, and yet my body live,<br />
As lend my body, palace to my soul,<br />
Away from her, and yet retain my soul.<br />
My body is her bower, her court, her abbey,<br />
And she an angel, pure, divine, unspotted;<br />
If I should lend her house, my lord, to thee,<br />
I kill my poor soul, and my poor soul me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once more, this last couplet is very much in the style of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
sonnets; nor is it wholly unlike even the dramatic style of Shakespeare
in his youth&mdash;and some dozen other poets or poeticules of the time.&nbsp;
But throughout this part of the play the recurrence of a faint and intermittent
resemblance to Shakespeare is more frequently noticeable than elsewhere.
<a name="citation252"></a><a href="#footnote252">{252}</a>&nbsp; A student
of imperfect memory but not of defective intuition might pardonably
assign such couplets, on hearing them cited, to the master-hand itself;
but such a student would be likelier to refer them to the sonnetteer
than to the dramatist.&nbsp; And a casual likeness to the style of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
sonnets is not exactly sufficient evidence to warrant such an otherwise
unwarrantable addition of appendage to the list of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays.</p>
<p>A little further on we come upon the first and last passage which
does actually recall by its wording a famous instance of the full and
ripened style of Shakespeare.</p>
<blockquote><p>He that doth clip or counterfeit your stamp<br />
Shall die, my lord: and will your sacred self<br />
Commit high treason &rsquo;gainst the King of heaven,<br />
To stamp his image in forbidden metal,<br />
Forgetting your allegiance and your oath?<br />
In violating marriage&rsquo; sacred law<br />
You break a greater honour than yourself;<br />
To be a king is of a younger house<br />
Than to be married: your progenitor,<br />
Sole reigning Adam on the universe,<br />
By God was honoured for a married man,<br />
But not by him anointed for a king.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every possible reader, I suppose, will at once bethink himself of
the famous passage in <i>Measure for Measure</i> which here may seem
to be faintly prefigured:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
were as good<br />
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen<br />
A man already made, as to remit<br />
Their saucy sweetness, that do coin heaven&rsquo;s image<br />
In stamps that are forbid:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the very difference of style is not wider than the gulf which
gapes between the first style of Shakespeare and the last.&nbsp; But
men of Shakespeare&rsquo;s stamp, I venture to think, do not thus repeat
themselves.&nbsp; The echo of the passage in <i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream</i>, describing the girlish friendship of Hermia and Helena, which
we find in the first act of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, describing
the like girlish friendship of Emilia and Flavina, is an echo of another
sort.&nbsp; Both, I need hardly say, are unquestionably Shakespeare&rsquo;s;
but the fashion in which the matured poet retouches and completes the
sketch of his earlier years&mdash;composes an oil painting, as it were,
from the hints and suggestions of a water-colour sketch long since designed
and long since half forgotten&mdash;is essentially different from the
mere verbal and literal trick of repetition which sciolists might think
to detect in the present instance.&nbsp; Again we must needs fall back
on the inevitable and indefinable test of style; a test which could
be of no avail if we were foolish enough to appeal to scholiasts and
their attendant dunces, but which should be of some avail if we appeal
to experts and their attentive scholars; and by this test we can but
remark that neither the passage in <i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>
nor the corresponsive passage in <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i> could
have been written by any hand known to us but Shakespeare&rsquo;s; whereas
the passage in <i>King Edward III</i>. might as certainly have been
written by any one out of a dozen poets then living as the answering
passage in <i>Measure for Measure</i> could assuredly have been written
by Shakespeare alone.</p>
<p>As on a first reading of the <i>Hippolytus</i> of Euripides we feel
that, for all the grace and freshness and lyric charm of its opening
scenes, the claim of the poem to our ultimate approval or disapproval
must needs depend on the success or failure of the first interview between
Theseus and his calumniated son; and as on finding that scene to be
feeble and futile and prosaic and verbose we feel that the poet who
had a woman&rsquo;s spite against women has here effectually and finally
shown himself powerless to handle the simplest elements of masculine
passion, of manly character and instinct; so in this less important
case we feel that the writer, having ventured on such a subject as the
compulsory temptation of a daughter by a father, who has been entrapped
into so shameful an undertaking through the treacherous exaction of
an equivocal promise unwarily confirmed by an inconsiderate oath, must
be judged by the result of his own enterprise; must fail or stand as
a poet by its failure or success.&nbsp; And his failure is only not
complete; he is but just redeemed from utter discomfiture by the fluency
and simplicity of his equable but inadequate style.&nbsp; Here as before
we find plentiful examples of the gracefully conventional tone current
among the lesser writers of the hour.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Warwick</i>.&nbsp; How shall I enter on this graceless
errand?<br />
I must not call her child; for where&rsquo;s the father<br />
That will in such a suit seduce his child?<br />
Then, <i>Wife of Salisbury</i>;&mdash;shall I so begin?<br />
No, he&rsquo;s my friend; and where is found the friend<br />
That will do friendship such endamagement?&mdash;<a name="citation255"></a><a href="#footnote255">{255}</a><br />
Neither my daughter, nor my dear friend&rsquo;s wife,<br />
I am not Warwick, as thou think&rsquo;st I am,<br />
But an attorney from the court of hell;<br />
That thus have housed my spirit in his form<br />
To do a message to thee from the king.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This beginning is fair enough, if not specially fruitful in promise;
but the verses following are of the flattest order of commonplace.&nbsp;
Hay and grass and the spear of Achilles&mdash;of which tradition</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the
moral is,<br />
What mighty men misdo, they can amend&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>these are the fresh and original types on which our little poet is
compelled to fall back for support and illustration to a scene so full
of terrible suggestion and pathetic possibility.</p>
<blockquote><p>The king will in his glory hide thy shame;<br />
And those that gaze on him to find out thee<br />
Will lose their eyesight, looking on the sun.<br />
What can one drop of poison harm the sea,<br />
Whose hugy vastures can digest the ill<br />
And make it lose its operation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so forth, and so forth; <i>ad libitum</i> if not <i>ad nauseam</i>.&nbsp;
Let us take but one or two more instances of the better sort.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp; Unnatural besiege!&nbsp; Woe me
unhappy,<br />
To have escaped the danger of my foes,<br />
And to be ten times worse invir&rsquo;d by friends!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Here we come upon two more words unknown to Shakespeare; <a name="citation256"></a><a href="#footnote256">{256}</a>
<i>besiege</i>, as a noun substantive, and <i>invired</i> for <i>environed</i>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Hath he no means to stain my honest blood<br />
But to corrupt the author of my blood<br />
To be his scandalous and vile soliciter?<br />
No marvel though the branches be infected,<br />
When poison hath encompass&egrave;d the roots;<br />
No marvel though the leprous infant die,<br />
When the stern dam envenometh the dug.<br />
Why then, give sin a passport to offend,<br />
And youth the dangerous rein of liberty;<br />
Blot out the strict forbidding of the law;<br />
And cancel every canon that prescribes<br />
A shame for shame or penance for offence.<br />
No, let me die, if his too boisterous will<br />
Will have it so, before I will consent<br />
To be an actor in his graceless lust.</p>
<p><i>Warwick</i>.&nbsp; Why, now thou speak&rsquo;st as I would have
thee speak;<br />
And mark how I unsay my words again.<br />
An honourable grave is more esteemed<br />
Than the polluted closet of a king;<br />
The greater man, the greater is the thing,<br />
Be it good or bad, that he shall undertake;<br />
An unreputed mote, flying in the sun,<br />
Presents a greater substance than it is;<br />
The freshest summer&rsquo;s day doth soonest taint<br />
The loath&egrave;d carrion that it seems to kiss;<br />
Deep are the blows made with a mighty axe;<br />
That sin doth ten times aggravate itself<br />
That is committed in a holy place;<br />
An evil deed, done by authority,<br />
Is sin, and subornation: Deck an ape<br />
In tissue, and the beauty of the robe<br />
Adds but the greater scorn unto the beast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Here are four passably good lines, which vaguely remind the reader
of something better read elsewhere; a common case enough with the more
tolerable work of small imitative poets.)</p>
<blockquote><p>A spacious field of reasons could I urge<br />
Between his glory, daughter, and thy shame:<br />
That poison shows worst in a golden cup;<br />
Dark night seems darker by the lightning flash;<br />
<i>Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds</i>;<br />
And every glory that inclines to sin,<br />
The shame is treble by the opposite.<br />
So leave I, with my blessing in thy bosom;<br />
Which then convert to a most heavy curse,<br />
When thou convert&rsquo;st from honour&rsquo;s golden name<br />
To the black faction of bed-blotting shame!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[<i>Exit</i>.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll follow thee:&mdash;And when my
mind turns so,<br />
My body sink my soul in endless woe!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[<i>Exit</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much for the central and crowning scene, the test, the climax,
the hinge on which the first part of this play turns; and seems to me,
in turning, to emit but a feeble and rusty squeak.&nbsp; No probable
reader will need to be reminded that the line which I have perhaps unnecessarily
italicised appears also as the last verse in the ninety-fourth of those
&ldquo;sugared sonnets&rdquo; which we know were in circulation about
the time of this play&rsquo;s first appearance among Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&ldquo;private friends&rdquo;; in other words, which enjoyed such a
kind of public privacy or private publicity as one or two among the
most eminent English poets of our own day have occasionally chosen for
some part of their work, to screen it for awhile as under the shelter
and the shade of crepuscular laurels, till ripe for the sunshine or
the storm of public judgment.&nbsp; In the present case, this debatable
verse looks to me more like a loan or maybe a theft from Shakespeare&rsquo;s
private store of undramatic poetry than a misapplication by its own
author to dramatic purposes of a line too apt and exquisite to endure
without injury the transference from its original setting.</p>
<p>The scene ensuing winds up the first part of this composite (or rather,
in one sense of the word, incomposite) poem.&nbsp; It may, on the whole,
be classed as something more than passably good: it is elegant, lively,
even spirited in style; showing at all events a marked advance upon
the scene which I have already stigmatised as a failure&mdash;that which
attempts to render the interview between Warwick and the King.&nbsp;
It is hardly, however, I should say, above the highest reach of Greene
or Peele at the smoothest and straightest of his flight.&nbsp; At its
opening, indeed, we come upon a line which inevitably recalls one of
the finest touches in a much later and deservedly more popular historical
drama.&nbsp; On being informed by Derby that</p>
<blockquote><p>The king is in his closet, malcontent,<br />
For what I know not, but he gave in charge,<br />
Till after dinner, none should interrupt him;<br />
The Countess Salisbury, and her father Warwick.<br />
Artois, and all, look underneath the brows;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>on receiving, I say, this ominous intimation, the prompt and statesmanlike
sagacity of Audley leads him at once as by intuition to the inference
thus eloquently expressed in a strain of thrilling and exalted poetry;</p>
<blockquote><p>Undoubtedly, then something is amiss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who can read this without a reminiscence of Sir Christopher Hatton&rsquo;s
characteristically cautious conclusion at sight of the military preparations
arrayed against the immediate advent of the Armada?</p>
<blockquote><p>I cannot but surmise&mdash;forgive, my friend,<br />
If the conjecture&rsquo;s rash&mdash;I cannot but<br />
Surmise the state some danger apprehends!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the entrance of the King the tone of this scene naturally rises&mdash;&ldquo;in
good time,&rdquo; as most readers will say.&nbsp; His brief interview
with the two nobles has at least the merit of ease and animation.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Derby</i>.&nbsp; Befall my sovereign all my sovereign&rsquo;s
wish!</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; Ah, that thou wert a witch, to make it so!</p>
<p><i>Derby</i>.&nbsp; The emperor greeteth you.</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Would it were the countess!</p>
<p><i>Derby</i>.&nbsp; And hath accorded to your highness&rsquo; suit.</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; Thou liest, she hath not: But I would she had!</p>
<p><i>Audley</i>.&nbsp; All love and duty to my lord the king!</p>
<p>Edward.&nbsp; <i>Well, all but one is none</i>:&mdash;What news with
you?</p>
<p><i>Audley</i>.&nbsp; I have, my liege, levied those horse and foot,<br />
According to your charge, and brought them hither.</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; Then let those foot trudge hence upon those
horse<br />
According to their discharge, and begone.&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Derby</i>. I&rsquo;ll look upon the countess&rsquo; mind<br />
Anon.</p>
<p><i>Derby</i>.&nbsp; The countess&rsquo; mind, my liege?</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; I mean, the emperor:&mdash;Leave me alone.</p>
<p><i>Audley</i>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s in his mind?</p>
<p><i>Derby</i>.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s leave him to his humour.</p>
<p>[<i>Exeunt</i> DERBY and AUDLEY</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; Thus from the heart&rsquo;s abundance speaks
the tongue<br />
Countess for emperor: And indeed, why not?<br />
She is as <i>imperator</i> over me;<br />
And I to her<br />
Am as a kneeling vassal, that observes<br />
The pleasure or displeasure of her eye.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this little scene there is perhaps on the whole more general likeness
to Shakespeare&rsquo;s earliest manner than we can trace in any other
passage of the play.&nbsp; But how much of Shakespeare&rsquo;s earliest
manner may be accounted the special and exclusive property of Shakespeare?</p>
<p>After this dismissal of the two nobles, the pimping poeticule, Villon
manqu&eacute; or (whom shall we call him?) r&eacute;ussi, reappears
with a message to C&aelig;sar (as the King is pleased to style himself)
from &ldquo;the more than Cleopatra&rsquo;s match&rdquo; (as he designates
the Countess), to intimate that &ldquo;ere night she will resolve his
majesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hereupon an unseasonable &ldquo;drum within&rdquo;
provokes Edward to the following remonstrance:</p>
<blockquote><p>What drum is this, that thunders forth this march,<br />
To start the tender Cupid in my bosom?<br />
Poor sheepskin, how it brawls with him that beateth it!<br />
Go, break the thundering parchment bottom out,<br />
And I will teach it to conduct sweet lines</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad; <i>conduct sweet lines</i> is bad.&rdquo;)</p>
<blockquote><p>Unto the bosom of a heavenly nymph:<br />
For I will use it as my writing paper;<br />
And so reduce him, from a scolding drum,<br />
To be the herald, and dear counsel-bearer,<br />
Betwixt a goddess and a mighty king.<br />
Go, bid the drummer learn to touch the lute,<br />
Or hang him in the braces of his drum;<br />
For now we think it an uncivil thing<br />
To trouble heaven with such harsh resounds.<br />
Away!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[<i>Exit</i> Lodowick.<br />
The quarrel that I have requires no arms<br />
But these of mine; and these shall meet my foe<br />
In a deep march of penetrable groans;<br />
My eyes shall be my arrows; and my sighs<br />
Shall serve me as the vantage of the wind<br />
To whirl away my sweet&rsquo;st <a name="citation261"></a><a href="#footnote261">{261}</a>
artillery:<br />
Ah, but, alas, she wins the sun of me,<br />
For that is she herself; and thence it comes<br />
That poets term the wanton warrior blind;<br />
But love hath eyes as judgment to his steps,<br />
Till too much lov&egrave;d glory dazzles them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hereupon Lodowick introduces the Black Prince (that is to be), and
&ldquo;retires to the door.&rdquo;&nbsp; The following scene opens well,
with a tone of frank and direct simplicity.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; I see the boy.&nbsp; O, how his
mother&rsquo;s face,<br />
Moulded in his, corrects my strayed desire,<br />
And rates my heart, and chides my thievish eye;<br />
Who, being rich enough in seeing her,<br />
Yet seeks elsewhere: and basest theft is that<br />
Which cannot check itself on poverty.&mdash;<br />
Now, boy, what news?</p>
<p><i>Prince</i>.&nbsp; I have assembled, my dear lord and father,<br />
The choicest buds of all our English blood,<br />
For our affairs in France; and here we come<br />
To take direction from your majesty.</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; Still do I see in him delineate<br />
His mother&rsquo;s visage; those his eyes are hers,<br />
Who, looking wistly <a name="citation262a"></a><a href="#footnote262a">{262a}</a>
on me, made me blush;<br />
For faults against themselves give evidence:<br />
Lust is a fire; and men, like lanterns, show<br />
Light lust within themselves even through themselves.<br />
Away, loose silks of wavering vanity!<br />
Shall the large limit of fair Brittany <a name="citation262b"></a><a href="#footnote262b">{262b}</a><br />
By me be overthrown? and shall I not<br />
Master this little mansion of myself?<br />
Give me an armour of eternal steel;<br />
I go to conquer kings.&nbsp; And shall I then<br />
Subdue myself, and be my enemy&rsquo;s friend?<br />
It must not be.&mdash;Come, boy, forward, advance!<br />
Let&rsquo;s with our colours sweep the air of France.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Lodowick announces the approach of the Countess &ldquo;with
a smiling cheer.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; Why, there it goes! that very smile
of hers<br />
Hath ransomed captive France; and set the king,<br />
The dauphin, and the peers, at liberty.&mdash;<br />
Go, leave me, Ned, and revel with thy friends.&nbsp; [<i>Exit</i> PRINCE.<br />
Thy mother is but black; and thou, like her,<br />
Dost put into my mind how foul she is.<br />
Go, fetch the countess hither in thy hand,<br />
And let her chase away these winter clouds;<br />
For she gives beauty both to heaven and earth.&nbsp; [<i>Exit</i> LODOWICK.<br />
The sin is more, to hack and hew poor men,<br />
Than to embrace in an unlawful bed<br />
The register of all rarieties <a name="citation263a"></a><a href="#footnote263a">{263a}</a><br />
Since leathern Adam till this youngest hour.</p>
<p><i>Re-enter</i> LODOWICK <i>with the</i> COUNTESS.</p>
<p>Go, Lodowick, put thy hand into my purse,<br />
Play, spend, give, riot, waste; do what thou wilt,<br />
So thou wilt hence awhile, and leave me here.&nbsp; [<i>Exit</i> LODOWICK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having already, out of a desire and determination to do no possible
injustice to the actual merits of this play in the eyes of any reader
who might never have gone over the text on which I had to comment, exceeded
in no small degree the limits I had intended to impose upon my task
in the way of citation, I shall not give so full a transcript from the
next and last scene between the Countess and the King.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; Now, my soul&rsquo;s playfellow!
art thou come<br />
To speak the more than heavenly word of yea<br />
To my objection in thy beauteous love?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Again, this singular use of the word <i>objection</i> in the sense
of offer or proposal has no parallel in the plays of Shakespeare.)</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp; My father on his blessing hath
commanded&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; That thou shalt yield to me.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp; Ay, dear my liege, your due.</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; And that, my dearest love, can be no less<br />
Than right for right, and render <a name="citation263b"></a><a href="#footnote263b">{263b}</a>
love for love.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp; Than wrong for wrong, and endless hate for
hate.<br />
But, sith I see your majesty so bent,<br />
That my unwillingness, my husband&rsquo;s love,<br />
Your high estate, nor no respect respected,<br />
Can be my help, but that your mightiness<br />
Will overbear and awe these dear regards,<br />
I bind my discontent to my content,<br />
And what I would not I&rsquo;ll compel I will;<br />
Provided that yourself remove those lets<br />
That stand between your highness&rsquo; love and mine.</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; Name them, fair countess, and by heaven I will.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp; It is their lives that stand between our love<br />
That I would have choked up, my sovereign.</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; Whose lives, my lady?</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My thrice loving liege,<br />
Your queen, and Salisbury my wedded husband;<br />
Who living have that title in our love<br />
That we can not bestow but by their death.</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; Thy opposition <a name="citation264a"></a><a href="#footnote264a">{264a}</a>
is beyond our law.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp; So is your desire: If the law <a name="citation264b"></a><a href="#footnote264b">{264b}</a><br />
Can hinder you to execute the one,<br />
Let it forbid you to attempt the other:<br />
I cannot think you love me as you say<br />
Unless you do make good what you have sworn.</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; No more: thy husband and the queen shall die.<br />
Fairer thou art by far than Hero was;<br />
Beardless Leander not so strong as I:<br />
He swom an easy current for his love;<br />
But I will, through a helly spout of blood, <a name="citation264c"></a><a href="#footnote264c">{264c}</a><br />
Arrive that Sestos where my Hero lies.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp; Nay, you&rsquo;ll do more; you&rsquo;ll make
the river too<br />
With their heartbloods that keep our love asunder;<br />
Of which my husband and your wife are twain.</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; Thy beauty makes them guilty of their death<br />
And gives in evidence that they shall die;<br />
Upon which verdict I their judge condemn them.</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp; O perjured beauty! more corrupted judge!<br />
When, to the great star-chamber o&rsquo;er our heads,<br />
The universal sessions calls to count<br />
This packing evil, we both shall tremble for it.</p>
<p><i>Edward</i>.&nbsp; What says my fair love? is she resolute?</p>
<p><i>Countess</i>.&nbsp; Resolute to be dissolved: <a name="citation266"></a><a href="#footnote266">{266}</a>
and, therefore, this:<br />
Keep but thy word, great king, and I am thine.<br />
Stand where thou dost; I&rsquo;ll part a little from thee;<br />
And see how I will yield me to thy hands.<br />
Here by my side do hang my wedding knives;<br />
Take thou the one, and with it kill thy queen,<br />
And learn by me to find her where she lies;<br />
And with the other I&rsquo;ll despatch my love,<br />
Which now lies fast asleep within my heart:<br />
When they are gone, then I&rsquo;ll consent to love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such genuinely good wine as this needs no bush.&nbsp; But from this
point onwards I can find nothing especially commendable in the remainder
of the scene except its brevity.&nbsp; The King of course abjures his
purpose, and of course compares the Countess with Lucretia to the disadvantage
of the Roman matron; summons his son, Warwick, and the attendant lords;
appoints each man his post by sea or land; and starts for Flanders in
a duly moral and military state of mind.</p>
<p>Here ends the first part of the play; and with it all possible indication,
though never so shadowy, of the possible shadowy presence of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
At the opening of the third act we are thrown among a wholly new set
of characters and events, all utterly out of all harmony and keeping
with all that has gone before.&nbsp; Edward alone survives as nominal
protagonist; but this survival&mdash;assuredly not of the fittest&mdash;is
merely the survival of the shadow of a name.&nbsp; Anything more pitifully
crude and feeble, more helplessly inartistic and incomposite, than this
process or pretence of juncture where there is no juncture, this infantine
shifting and shuffling of the scenes and figures, it is impossible to
find among the rudest and weakest attempts of the dawning or declining
drama in its first or second childhood.</p>
<p>It is the less necessary to analyse at any length the three remaining
acts of this play, that the work has already been done to my hand, and
well done, by Charles Knight; who, though no professed critic or esoteric
expert in Shakespearean letters, approved himself by dint of sheer honesty
and conscience not unworthy of a considerate hearing.&nbsp; To his edition
of Shakespeare I therefore refer all readers desirous of further excerpts
than I care to give.</p>
<p>The first scene of the third act is a storehouse of contemporary
commonplace.&nbsp; Nothing fresher than such stale pot-pourri as the
following is to be gathered up in thin sprinklings from off the dry
flat soil.&nbsp; A messenger informs the French king that he has descried
off shore</p>
<blockquote><p>The proud armado (<i>sic</i>) of King Edward&rsquo;s
ships;<br />
Which at the first, far off when I did ken,<br />
Seemed as it were a grove of withered pines;<br />
But, drawing on, their glorious bright aspect,<br />
Their streaming ensigns wrought of coloured silk,<br />
Like to a meadow full of sundry flowers,<br />
Adorns the naked bosom of the earth;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so on after the exactest and therefore feeblest fashion of the
Pre-Marlowites; with equal regard, as may be seen, for grammar and for
sense in the construction of his periods.&nbsp; The narrative of a sea-fight
ensuing on this is pitiable beyond pity and contemptibly beneath contempt.</p>
<p>In the next scene we have a flying view of peasants in flight, with
a description of five cities on fire not undeserving of its place in
the play, immediately after the preceding sea-piece: but relieved by
such wealth of pleasantry as marks the following jest, in which the
most purblind eye will be the quickest to discover a touch of the genuine
Shakespearean humour.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>1st Frenchman</i>.&nbsp; What, is it quarter-day,
that you remove,<br />
And carry bag and baggage too?</p>
<p><i>2nd Frenchman</i>.&nbsp; Quarter-day? ay, and quartering-day,
I fear.<br />
<i>Euge</i>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scene of debate before Cressy is equally flat and futile, vulgar
and verbose; yet in this Sham Shakespearean scene of our present poeticule&rsquo;s
I have noted one genuine Shakespearean word, &ldquo;solely singular
for its singleness.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>So may thy temples with Bellona&rsquo;s hand<br />
Be still adorned with laurel victory!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this notably inelegant expression of goodwill we find the same
use of the word &ldquo;laurel&rdquo; as an adjective and epithet of
victory which thus confronts us in the penultimate speech of the third
scene in the first act of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
your sword<br />
Sit laurel victory, and smooth success<br />
Be strewed before your feet!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is something more (as less there could not be) of spirit and
movement in the battle-scene where Edward refuses to send relief to
his son, wishing the prince to win his spurs unaided, and earn the first-fruits
of his fame single-handed against the heaviest odds; but the forcible
feebleness of a minor poet&rsquo;s fancy shows itself amusingly in the
mock stoicism and braggart philosophy of the King&rsquo;s reassuring
reflection, &ldquo;We have more sons than one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first and third scenes of the fourth act we may concede some
slight merit to the picture of a chivalrous emulation in magnanimity
between the Duke of Burgundy and his former fellow-student, whose refusal
to break his parole as a prisoner extorts from his friend the concession
refused to his importunity as an envoy: but the execution is by no means
worthy of the subject.</p>
<p>The limp loquacity of long-winded rhetoric, so natural to men and
soldiers in an hour of emergency, which distinguishes the dialogue between
the Black Prince and Audley on the verge of battle, is relieved by this
one last touch of quasi-Shakespearean thought or style discoverable
in the play of which I must presently take a short&mdash;and a long&mdash;farewell.</p>
<blockquote><p>Death&rsquo;s name is much more mighty than his deeds:<br />
Thy parcelling this power hath made it more.<br />
As many sands as these my hands can hold<br />
Are but my handful of so many sands;<br />
Then all the world&mdash;and call it but a power&mdash;<br />
Easily ta&rsquo;en up, and <a name="citation269"></a><a href="#footnote269">{269}</a>
quickly thrown away;<br />
But if I stand to count them sand by sand<br />
The number would confound my memory<br />
And make a thousand millions of a task<br />
Which briefly is no more indeed than one.<br />
These quartered squadrons and these regiments<br />
Before, behind us, and on either hand,<br />
Are but a power: When we name a man,<br />
His hand, his foot, his head, have several strengths;<br />
And being all but one self instant strength,<br />
Why, all this many, Audley, is but one,<br />
And we can call it all but one man&rsquo;s strength.<br />
He that hath far to go tells it by miles;<br />
If he should tell the steps, it kills his heart:<br />
The drops are infinite that make a flood,<br />
And yet, thou know&rsquo;st, we call it but a rain.<br />
There is but one France, one king of France, <a name="citation270"></a><a href="#footnote270">{270}</a><br />
That France hath no more kings; and that same king<br />
Hath but the puissant legion of one king;<br />
And we have one: Then apprehend no odds;<br />
For one to one is fair equality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Bien coup&eacute;, mal cousu</i>; such is the most favourable
verdict I can pass on this voluminous effusion of a spirit smacking
rather of the schools than of the field.&nbsp; The first six lines or
so might pass muster as the early handiwork of Shakespeare; the rest
has as little of his manner as his matter, his metre as his style.</p>
<p>The poet can hardly be said to rise again after this calamitous collapse.&nbsp;
We find in the rest of this scene nothing better worth remark than such
poor catches at a word as this;</p>
<blockquote><p>And let those milkwhite messengers of time<br />
Show thy time&rsquo;s learning in this dangerous time;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a villainous trick of verbiage which went nigh now and then to affect
the adolescent style of Shakespeare, and which happens to find itself
as admirably as unconsciously burlesqued in two lines of this very scene:</p>
<blockquote><p>I will not give a penny for a life,<br />
Nor half a halfpenny to shun grim death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verses intervening are smooth, simple, and passably well worded;
indeed the force of elegant commonplace cannot well go further than
in such lines as these.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thyself art bruised and bent with many broils,<br />
And stratagems forepast with iron pens<br />
Are tex&egrave;d <a name="citation271"></a><a href="#footnote271">{271}</a>
in thine honourable face;<br />
Thou art a married man in this distress,<br />
But danger woos me as a blushing maid;<br />
Teach me an answer to this perilous time.</p>
<p><i>Audley</i>.&nbsp; To die is all as common as to live;<br />
The one in choice, the other holds in chase;<br />
For from the instant we begin to live<br />
We do pursue and hunt the time to die:<br />
First bud we, then we blow, and after seed;<br />
Then presently we fall; and as a shade<br />
Follows the body, so we follow death.<br />
If then we hunt for death, why do we fear it?<br />
If we fear it, why do we follow it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Let me intimate a doubt in passing, whether Shakespeare would ever
have put by the mouth of any but a farcical mask a query so provocative
of response from an Irish echo&mdash;&ldquo;Because we can&rsquo;t help.&rdquo;)</p>
<blockquote><p>If we do fear, with fear we do but aid<br />
The thing we fear to seize on us the sooner;<br />
If we fear not, then no resolv&egrave;d proffer<br />
Can overthrow the limit of our fate:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so forth.&nbsp; Again the hastiest reader will have been reminded
of a passage in the transcendant central scenes of <i>Measure for Measure</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merely,
thou art death&rsquo;s fool;<br />
For him thou labour&rsquo;st by thy flight to shun,<br />
And yet runn&rsquo;st toward him still;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and hence also some may infer that this pitiful penny-whistle was
blown by the same breath which in time gained power to fill that archangelic
trumpet.&nbsp; Credat Zoilus Shakespearomastix, non ego.</p>
<p>The next scene is something better than passable, but demands no
special analysis and affords no necessary extract.&nbsp; We may just
observe as examples of style the play on words between the flight of
hovering ravens and the flight of routed soldiers, and the description
of the sudden fog</p>
<blockquote><p>Which now hath hid the airy floor of heaven,<br />
And made at noon a night unnatural<br />
Upon the quaking and dismay&egrave;d world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interest rises again with the reappearance and release of Salisbury,
and lifts the style for a moment to its own level.&nbsp; <i>&Agrave;
tout seigneur tout honneur</i>; the author deserves some dole of moderate
approbation for his tribute to the national chivalry of a Frenchman
as here exemplified in the person of Prince Charles.</p>
<p>Of the two next scenes, in which the battle of Poitiers is so inadequately
&ldquo;staged to the show,&rdquo; I can only say that if any reader
believes them to be the possible work of the same hand which set before
all men&rsquo;s eyes for all time the field of Agincourt, he will doubtless
die in that belief, and go to his own place in the limbo of commentators.</p>
<p>But a yet more flagrant effect of contrast is thrust upon our notice
at the opening of the fifth act.&nbsp; If in all the historical groundwork
of this play there is one point of attraction which we might have thought
certain to stimulate the utmost enterprise and evoke the utmost capacities
of an aspiring dramatist, it must surely be sought in the crowning scene
of the story; in the scene of Queen Philippa&rsquo;s intercession for
the burgesses of Calais.&nbsp; We know how Shakespeare on the like occasion
was wont to transmute into golden verse the silver speech supplied to
him by North&rsquo;s version of Amyot&rsquo;s Plutarch. <a name="citation273"></a><a href="#footnote273">{273}</a>&nbsp;
With the text of Lord Berners before him, the author of <i>King Edward
III</i>. has given us for the gold of Froissart not even adulterated
copper, but unadulterated lead.&nbsp; Incredible as it may seem to readers
of the historian, the poeticule has actually contrived so far to transfigure
by dint of disfiguring him that this most noble and pathetic scene in
all the annals of chivalry, when passed through the alembic of his incompetence,
appears in a garb of transforming verse under a guise at once weak and
wordy, coarse and unchivalrous.&nbsp; The whole scene is at all points
alike in its unlikeness to the workmanship of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Here then I think we may finally draw bridle: for the rest of the
course is not worth running; there is nothing in the residue of this
last act which deserves analysis or calls for commentary.&nbsp; We have
now examined the whole main body of the work with somewhat more than
necessary care; and our conclusion is simply this: that if any man of
common reading, common modesty, common judgment, and common sense, can
be found to maintain the theory of Shakespeare&rsquo;s possible partnership
in the composition of this play, such a man will assuredly admit that
the only discernible or imaginable touches of his hand are very slight,
very few, and very early.&nbsp; For myself, I am and have always been
perfectly satisfied with one single and simple piece of evidence that
Shakespeare had not a finger in the concoction of <i>King Edward III</i>.&nbsp;
He was the author of <i>King Henry V</i>.</p>
<h4>NOTE.</h4>
<p>I was not surprised to hear that my essay on the historical play
of King Edward III. had on its first appearance met in various quarters
with assailants of various kinds.&nbsp; There are some forms of attack
to which no answer is possible for a man of any human self-respect but
the lifelong silence of contemptuous disgust.&nbsp; To such as these
I will never condescend to advert or to allude further than by the remark
now as it were forced from me, that never once in my life have I had
or will I have recourse in self-defence either to the blackguard&rsquo;s
loaded bludgeon of personalities or to the dastard&rsquo;s sheathed
dagger of disguise.&nbsp; I have reviled no man&rsquo;s person: I have
outraged no man&rsquo;s privacy.&nbsp; When I have found myself misled
either by imperfection of knowledge or of memory, or by too much confidence
in a generally trustworthy guide, I have silently corrected the misquotation
or readily repaired the error.&nbsp; To the successive and representative
heroes of the undying Dunciad I have left and will always leave the
foul use of their own foul weapons.&nbsp; I have spoken freely and fearlessly,
and so shall on all occasions continue to speak, of what I find to be
worthy of praise or dispraise, contempt or honour, in the public works
and actions of men.&nbsp; Here ends and here has always ended in literary
matters the proper province of a gentleman; beyond it, though sometimes
intruded on in time past by trespassers of a nobler race, begins the
proper province of a blackguard.</p>
<h3>REPORT ON THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY SESSION OF THE
NEWEST SHAKESPEARE SOCIETY.</h3>
<p>A paper was read by Mr. A. on the disputed authorship of <i>A Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>.&nbsp; He was decidedly of opinion that this
play was to be ascribed to George Chapman.&nbsp; He based this opinion
principally on the ground of style.&nbsp; From its similarity of subject
he had at first been disposed to assign it to Cyril Tourneur, author
of <i>The Revenger&rsquo;s Tragedy</i>; and he had drawn up in support
of this theory a series of parallel passages extracted from the speeches
of Vindice in that drama and of Oberon in the present play.&nbsp; He
pointed out however that the character of Puck could hardly have been
the work of any English poet but the author of <i>Bussy d&rsquo;Ambois</i>.&nbsp;
There was here likewise that gravity and condensation of thought conveyed
through the medium of the &ldquo;full and heightened style&rdquo; commended
by Webster, and that preponderance of philosophic or political discourse
over poetic interest and dramatic action for which the author in question
had been justly censured.</p>
<p>Some of the audience appearing slightly startled by this remark (indeed
it afterwards appeared that the Chairman had been on the point of asking
the learned member whether he was not thinking rather of <i>Love&rsquo;s
Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>?), Mr. A. cited the well-known scene in which
Oberon discourses with Puck on matters concerning Mary Stuart and Queen
Elizabeth, instead of despatching him at once on his immediate errand.&nbsp;
This was universally accepted as proof positive, and the reading concluded
amid signs of unanimous assent, when</p>
<p>Mr. B. had nothing to urge against the argument they had just heard,
but he must remind them that there was a more weighty kind of evidence
than that adduced by Mr. A.; and to this he doubted not they would all
defer.&nbsp; He could prove by a tabulated statement that the words
&ldquo;to&rdquo; and &ldquo;from&rdquo; occurred on an average from
seven to nine times in every play of Chapman; whereas in the play under
consideration the word &ldquo;to&rdquo; occurred exactly twelve times
and the word &ldquo;from&rdquo; precisely ten.&nbsp; He was therefore
of opinion that the authorship should in all probability be assigned
to Anthony Munday.</p>
<p>As nobody present could dispute this conclusion, Mr. C. proceeded
to read the argument by which he proposed to establish the fact, hitherto
unaccountably overlooked by all preceding commentators, that the character
of Romeo was obviously designed as a satire on Lord Burghley.&nbsp;
The first and perhaps the strongest evidence in favour of this proposition
was the extreme difficulty, he might almost say the utter impossibility,
of discovering a single point of likeness between the two characters.&nbsp;
This would naturally be the first precaution taken by a poor player
who designed to attack an all-powerful Minister.&nbsp; But more direct
light was thrown upon the subject by a passage in which &ldquo;that
kind of fruit that maids call medlars when they laugh alone&rdquo; is
mentioned in connection with a wish of Romeo&rsquo;s regarding his mistress.&nbsp;
This must evidently be taken to refer to some recent occasion on which
the policy of Lord Burghley (possibly in the matter of the Anjou marriage)
had been rebuked in private by the Maiden Queen, &ldquo;his mistress,&rdquo;
as meddling, laughable, and fruitless.</p>
<p>This discovery seemed to produce a great impression till the Chairman
reminded the Society that the play in question was now generally ascribed
to George Peele, <a name="citation278"></a><a href="#footnote278">{278}</a>
who was notoriously the solicitor of Lord Burghley&rsquo;s patronage
and the recipient of his bounty.&nbsp; That this poet was the author
of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> could no longer be a matter of doubt, as
he was confident they would all agree with him on hearing that a living
poet of note had positively assured him of the fact; adding that he
had always thought so when at school.&nbsp; The plaudits excited by
this announcement had scarcely subsided, when the Chairman clenched
the matter by observing that he rather thought the same opinion had
ultimately been entertained by his own grandmother.</p>
<p>Mr. D. then read a paper on the authorship and the hidden meaning
of two contemporary plays which, he must regretfully remark, were too
obviously calculated to cast a most unfavourable and even sinister light
on the moral character of the new Shakespeare; whose possibly suspicious
readiness to attack the vices of others with a view to diverting attention
from his own was signally exemplified in the well-known fact that, even
while putting on a feint of respect and tenderness for his memory, he
had exposed the profligate haunts and habits of Christopher Marlowe
under the transparent pseudonym of Christopher Sly.&nbsp; To the first
of these plays attention had long since been drawn by a person of whom
it was only necessary to say that he had devoted a long life to the
study and illustration of Shakespeare and his age, and had actually
presumed to publish a well-known edition of the poet at a date previous
to the establishment of the present Society.&nbsp; He (Mr. D.) was confident
that not another syllable could be necessary to expose that person to
the contempt of all present.&nbsp; He proceeded, however, with the kind
encouragement of the Chairman, to indulge at that editor&rsquo;s expense
in sundry personalities both &ldquo;loose and humorous,&rdquo; which
being totally unfit for publication here are reserved for a private
issue of &ldquo;Loose and Humorous Papers&rdquo; to be edited, with
a running marginal commentary or illustrative and explanatory version
of the utmost possible fullness, <a name="citation279"></a><a href="#footnote279">{279}</a>
by the Founder and another member of the Society.&nbsp; To these it
might possibly be undesirable for them to attract the notice of the
outside world.&nbsp; Reverting therefore to his first subject from various
references to the presumed private character, habits, gait, appearance,
and bearing of the gentleman in question, Mr. D. observed that the ascription
of a share in the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i> to William Haughton (hitherto
supposed the author of a comedy called <i>Englishmen for my Money</i>)
implied a doubly discreditable blunder.&nbsp; The real fact, as he would
immediately prove, was not that Haughton was joint author with Shakespeare
of the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, but that Shakespeare was joint author
with Haughton of <i>Englishmen for my Money</i>.&nbsp; He would not
enlarge on the obvious fact that Shakespeare, so notorious a plunderer
of others, had actually been reduced to steal from his own poor store
an image transplanted from the last scene of the third act of <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i> into the last scene of the third act of <i>Englishmen
for my Money</i>; where the well-known and pitiful phrase&mdash;&ldquo;Night&rsquo;s
candles are burnt out&rdquo;&mdash;reappears in all its paltry vulgarity
as follows;&mdash;&ldquo;Night&rsquo;s candles burn obscure.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ample as was the proof here supplied, he would prefer to rely exclusively
upon such further evidence as might be said to lie at once on the surface
and in a nutshell.</p>
<p>The second title of this play, by which the first title was in a
few years totally superseded, ran thus: <i>A Woman will have her Will</i>.&nbsp;
Now even in an age of punning titles such as that of a well-known and
delightful treatise by Sir John Harrington, the peculiar fondness of
Shakespeare for puns was notorious; but especially for puns on names,
as in the proverbial case of Sir Thomas Lucy; and above all for puns
on his own Christian name, as in his 135th, 136th, and 143rd sonnets.&nbsp;
It must now be but too evident to the meanest intelligence&mdash;to
the meanest intelligence, he repeated; for to such only did he or would
he then and there or ever or anywhere address himself&mdash;(loud applause)
that the graceless author, more utterly lost to all sense of shame than
any Don Juan or other typical libertine of fiction, had come forward
to placard by way of self-advertisement on his own stage, and before
the very eyes of a Maiden Queen, the scandalous confidence in his own
powers of fascination and seduction so cynically expressed in the too
easily intelligible vaunt&mdash;A Woman will have her Will [Shakespeare].&nbsp;
In the penultimate line of the hundred and forty-third sonnet the very
phrase might be said to occur:</p>
<blockquote><p>So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having thus established his case in the first instance to the satisfaction,
as he trusted, not only of the present Society, but of any asylum for
incurables in any part of the country, the learned member now passed
on to the consideration of the allusions at once to Shakespeare and
to a celebrated fellow-countryman, fellow-poet, and personal friend
of his&mdash;Michael Drayton&mdash;contained in a play which had been
doubtfully attributed to Shakespeare himself by such absurd idiots as
looked rather to the poetical and dramatic quality of a poem or a play
than to such tests as those to which alone any member of that Society
would ever dream of appealing.&nbsp; What these were he need not specify;
it was enough to say in recommendation of them that they had rather
less to do with any question of dramatic or other poetry than with the
differential calculus or the squaring of the circle.&nbsp; It followed
that only the most perversely ignorant and &aelig;sthetically presumptuous
of readers could imagine the possibility of Shakespeare&rsquo;s concern
or partnership in a play which had no more Shakespearean quality about
it than mere poetry, mere passion, mere pathos, mere beauty and vigour
of thought and language, mere command of dramatic effect, mere depth
and subtlety of power to read, interpret, and reproduce the secrets
of the heart and spirit.&nbsp; Could any further evidence be required
of the unfitness and unworthiness to hold or to utter any opinion on
the matter in hand which had consistently been displayed by the poor
creatures to whom he had just referred, it would be found, as he felt
sure the Founder and all worthy members of their Society would be the
first to admit, in the despicable diffidence, the pitiful modesty, the
contemptible deficiency in common assurance, with which the suggestion
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s partnership in this play had generally been put
forward and backed up.&nbsp; The tragedy of <i>Arden of Feversham</i>
was indeed connected with Shakespeare&mdash;and that, as he should proceed
to show, only too intimately; but Shakespeare was not connected with
it&mdash;that is, in the capacity of its author.&nbsp; In what capacity
would be but too evident when he mentioned the names of the two leading
ruffians concerned in the murder of the principal character&mdash;Black
Will and Shakebag.&nbsp; The single original of these two characters
he need scarcely pause to point out.&nbsp; It would be observed that
a double precaution had been taken against any charge of libel or personal
attack which might be brought against the author and supported by the
all-powerful court influence of Shakespeare&rsquo;s two principal patrons,
the Earls of Essex and Southampton.&nbsp; Two figures were substituted
for one, and the unmistakable name of Will Shakebag was cut in half
and divided between them.&nbsp; Care had moreover been taken to disguise
the person by altering the complexion of the individual aimed at.&nbsp;
That the actual Shakespeare was a fair man they had the evidence of
the coloured bust at Stratford.&nbsp; Could any capable and fair-minded
man&mdash;he would appeal to their justly honoured Founder&mdash;require
further evidence as to the original of Black Will Shakebag?&nbsp; Another
important character in the play was Black Will&rsquo;s accomplice and
Arden&rsquo;s servant&mdash;Michael, after whom the play had also at
one time been called <i>Murderous Michael</i>.&nbsp; The single fact
that Shakespeare and Drayton were both of them Warwickshire men would
suffice, he could not doubt, to carry conviction with it to the mind
of every member present, with regard to the original of this personage.&nbsp;
It now only remained for him to produce the name of the real author
of this play.&nbsp; He would do so at once&mdash;Ben Jonson.&nbsp; About
the time of its production Jonson was notoriously engaged in writing
those additions to the <i>Spanish Tragedy</i> of which a preposterous
attempt had been made to deprive him on the paltry ground that the style
(forsooth) of these additional scenes was very like the style of Shakespeare
and utterly unlike the style of Jonson.&nbsp; To dispose for ever of
this pitiful argument it would be sufficient to mention the names of
its two first and principal supporters&mdash;Charles Lamb and Samuel
Taylor Coleridge (hisses and laughter).&nbsp; Now, in these &ldquo;adycions
to Jeronymo&rdquo; a painter was introduced complaining of the murder
of his son.&nbsp; In the play before them a painter was introduced as
an accomplice in the murder of Arden.&nbsp; It was unnecessary to dwell
upon so trivial a point of difference as that between the stage employment
or the moral character of the one artist and the other.&nbsp; In either
case they were as closely as possible connected with a murder.&nbsp;
There was a painter in the <i>Spanish Tragedy</i>, and there was also
a painter in <i>Arden of Feversham</i>.&nbsp; He need not&mdash;he would
not add another word in confirmation of the now established fact, that
Ben Jonson had in this play held up to perpetual infamy&mdash;whether
deserved or undeserved he would not pretend to say&mdash;the names of
two poets who afterwards became his friends, but whom he had previously
gibbeted or at least pilloried in public as Black Will Shakespeare and
Murderous Michael Drayton.</p>
<p>Mr. E. then brought forward a subject of singular interest and importance&mdash;&ldquo;The
lameness of Shakespeare&mdash;was it moral or physical?&rdquo;&nbsp;
He would not insult their intelligence by dwelling on the absurd and
exploded hypothesis that this expression was allegorical, but would
at once assume that the infirmity in question was physical.&nbsp; Then
arose the question&mdash;In which leg?&nbsp; He was prepared, on the
evidence of an early play, to prove to demonstration that the injured
and interesting limb was the left.&nbsp; &ldquo;This shoe is my father,&rdquo;
says Launce in the <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>; &ldquo;no, this left
shoe is my father; no, no, this left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot
be so neither; yes, it is so, it is so; <i>it hath the worser sole</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This passage was not necessary either to the progress of the play or
to the development of the character; he believed he was justified in
asserting that it was not borrowed from the original novel on which
the play was founded; the inference was obvious, that without some personal
allusion it must have been as unintelligib1e to the audience as it had
hitherto been to the commentators.&nbsp; His conjecture was confirmed,
and the whole subject illustrated with a new light, by the well-known
line in one of the Sonnets, in which the poet describes himself as &ldquo;made
lame by Fortune&rsquo;s dearest spite&rdquo;: a line of which the inner
meaning and personal application had also by a remarkable chance been
reserved for him (Mr. E.) to discover.&nbsp; There could be no doubt
that we had here a clue to the origin of the physical infirmity referred
to; an accident which must have befallen Shakespeare in early life while
acting at the Fortune theatre, and consequently before his connection
with a rival company; a fact of grave importance till now unverified.&nbsp;
The epithet &ldquo;dearest,&rdquo; like so much else in the Sonnets,
was evidently susceptible of a double interpretation.&nbsp; The first
and most natural explanation of the term would at once suggest itself;
the playhouse would of necessity be dearest to the actor dependent on
it for subsistence, as the means of getting his bread; but he thought
it not unreasonable to infer from this unmistakable allusion that the
entrance fee charged at the Fortune may probably have been higher than
the price of seats in any other house.&nbsp; Whether or not this fact,
taken in conjunction with the accident already mentioned, should be
assumed as the immediate cause of Shakespeare&rsquo;s subsequent change
of service, he was not prepared to pronounce with such positive confidence
as they might naturally expect from a member of the Society; but he
would take upon himself to affirm that his main thesis was now and for
ever established on the most irrefragable evidence, and that no assailant
could by any possibility dislodge by so much as a hair&rsquo;s breadth
the least fragment of a single brick in the impregnable structure of
proof raised by the argument to which they had just listened.</p>
<p>This demonstration being thus satisfactorily concluded, Mr. F. proceeded
to read his paper on the date of <i>Othello</i>, and on the various
parts of that play respectively assignable to Samuel Rowley, to George
Wilkins, and to Robert Daborne.&nbsp; It was evident that the story
of Othello and Desdemona was originally quite distinct from that part
of the play in which Iago was a leading figure.&nbsp; This he was prepared
to show at some length by means of the weak-ending test, the light-ending
test, the double-ending test, the triple-ending test, the heavy-monosyllabic-eleventh-syllable-of-the-double-ending
test, the run-on-line test, and the central-pause test.&nbsp; Of the
partnership of other poets in the play he was able to adduce a simpler
but not less cogent proof.&nbsp; A member of their Committee said to
an objector lately: &ldquo;To me, there are the handwritings of four
different men, the thoughts and powers of four different men, in the
play.&nbsp; If you can&rsquo;t see them now, you must wait till, by
study, you can.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t give you eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this
argument he (Mr. F.) felt that it would be an insult to their understandings
if he should attempt to add another word.&nbsp; Still, for those who
were willing to try and learn, and educate their ears and eyes, he had
prepared six tabulated statements&mdash;</p>
<p>(At this important point of a most interesting paper, our reporter
unhappily became unconscious, and remained for some considerable period
in a state of deathlike stupor.&nbsp; On recovering from this total
and unaccountable suspension of all his faculties, he found the speaker
drawing gradually near the end of his figures, and so far succeeded
in shaking off the sense of coma as to be able to resume his notes.)</p>
<p>That the first and fourth scenes of the third act were not by the
same hand as the third scene he should have no difficulty in proving
to the satisfaction of all capable and fair-minded men.&nbsp; In the
first and fourth scenes the word &ldquo;virtuous&rdquo; was used as
a dissyllable; in the third it was used as a trisyllable.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona.&rdquo;
iii. 1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.&rdquo; iii. 3.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That by your virtuous means I may again.&rdquo; iii. 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the third scene he would also point out the great number of triple
endings which had originally led the able editor of Euclid&rsquo;s Elements
of Geometry to attribute the authorship of this scene to Shirley: <i>Cassio</i>
(twice), <i>patience</i>, <i>Cassio</i> (again), <i>discretion</i>,
<i>Cassio</i> (again), honesty, <i>Cassio</i> (again), <i>jealousy,
jealous</i> (used as a trisyllable in the verse of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
time), company (two consecutive lines with the triple ending), <i>Cassio</i>
(again), <i>conscience, petition, ability, importunity, conversation,
marriage, dungeon, mandragora, passion, monstrous, conclusion, bounteous</i>.&nbsp;
He could not imagine any man in his senses questioning the weight of
this evidence.&nbsp; Now, let them take the rhymed speeches of the Duke
and Brabantio in Act i. Sc. 3, and compare them with the speech of Othello
in Act iv. Sc. 2,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had it pleased heaven<br />
To try me with affliction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He appealed to any expert whether this was not in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
easy fourth budding manner, with, too, various other points already
touched on.&nbsp; On the other hand, take the opening of Brabantio&rsquo;s
speech&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;<br />
We lose it not so long as we can smile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That, he said, was in Shakespeare&rsquo;s difficult second flowering
manner&mdash;the style of the later part of the earlier stage of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
rhetorical first period but one.&nbsp; It was no more possible to move
the one passage up to the date of the other than to invert the order
of the alphabet.&nbsp; Here, then, putting aside for the moment the
part of the play supplied by Shakespeare&rsquo;s assistants in the last
three acts&mdash;miserably weak some of it was&mdash;they were able
to disentangle the early love-play from the latter work in which Iago
was principally concerned.&nbsp; There was at least fifteen years&rsquo;
growth between them, the steps of which could he traced in the poet&rsquo;s
intermediate plays by any one who chose to work carefully enough at
them.&nbsp; Set any of the speeches addressed in the Shakespeare part
of the last act by Othello to Desdemona beside the consolatory address
of the Duke to Brabantio, and see the difference of the rhetoric and
style in the two.&nbsp; If they turned to characters, Othello and Desdemona
were even more clearly the companion pair to Biron and Rosaline of <i>Love&rsquo;s
Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i> than were Falstaff and Doll Tearsheet the match-pair
(<i>sic</i>) of Romeo and Juliet.&nbsp; In <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost</i> the question of complexion was identical, though the parts
were reversed.&nbsp; He would cite but a few parallel passages in evidence
of this relationship between the subjects of the two plays.</p>
<pre>   <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>, iv. 3.            <i>Othello</i>.
1. &ldquo;By heaven, thy love is black   1.  &ldquo;An old black ram.&rdquo; i. 1.
                 as ebony.&rdquo;
2. &ldquo;No face is <i>fair</i> that is not    2.  &ldquo;Your son-in-law is far more
            full so black.&rdquo;                   <i>fair</i> than black.&rdquo; i. 3.
3.  &ldquo;O paradox! Black is the       3.  &ldquo;How if she be black and
            badge of hell.&rdquo;                         witty?&rdquo; ii. 1.
4.  &ldquo;O, <i>if</i> in black my lady&rsquo;s      4.  &ldquo;<i>If</i> she be black, and thereto
           brows be decked.&rdquo;                       have a wit.&rdquo; id.
5.  &ldquo;And therefore is she born     5.  &ldquo;A measure to the health of
        to make black fair.&rdquo;                    black Othello.&rdquo; ii. 3.
6.  &ldquo;Paints itself black to        6.  &ldquo;For I am black.&rdquo; iii, 3.
        imitate her brow.&rdquo;
7.  &ldquo;To look like her are          7.  &ldquo;<i>Begrimed</i> and black.&rdquo; id.
      <i>chimney-sweepers</i> black.&rdquo;</pre>
<p>Now, with these parallel passages before them, what man, woman, or
child could bring himself or herself to believe that the connection
of these plays was casual or the date of the first Othello removable
from the date of the early contemporary late-first-period-but-one play
<i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>, or that anybody&rsquo;s opinion
that they were so was worth one straw?&nbsp; When therefore by the introduction
of the Iago episode Shakespeare in his later days had with the assistance
of three fellow-poets completed the unfinished work of his youth, the
junction thus effected of the Brabantio part of the play with this Iago
underplot supplied them with an evidence wholly distinct from that of
the metrical test which yet confirmed in every point the conclusion
independently arrived at and supported by the irresistible coincidence
of all the tests.&nbsp; He defied anybody to accept his principle of
study or adopt his method of work, and arrive at a different conclusion
from himself.</p>
<p>The reading of Mr. G.&rsquo;s paper on the authorship of the soliloquies
in <i>Hamlet</i> was unavoidably postponed till the next meeting, the
learned member having only time on this occasion to give a brief summary
of the points he was prepared to establish and the grounds on which
he was prepared to establish them.&nbsp; A year or two since, when he
first thought of starting the present Society, he had never read a line
of the play in question, having always understood it to be admittedly
spurious: but on being assured of the contrary by one of the two foremost
poets of the English-speaking world, who was good enough to read out
to him in proof of this assertion all that part of the play which could
reasonably be assigned to Shakespeare, he had of course at once surrendered
his own former opinion, well grounded as it had hitherto seemed to be
on the most solid of all possible foundations.&nbsp; At their next meeting
he would show cause for attributing to Ben Jonson not only the soliloquies
usually but inconsiderately quoted as Shakespeare&rsquo;s, but the entire
original conception of the character of the Prince of Denmark.&nbsp;
The resemblance of this character to that of Volpone in <i>The Fox</i>
and to that of Face in <i>The Alchemist</i> could not possibly escape
the notice of the most cursory reader.&nbsp; The principle of disguise
was the same in each case, whether the end in view were simply personal
profit, or (as in the case of Hamlet) personal profit combined with
revenge; and whether the disguise assumed was that of madness, of sickness,
or of a foreign personality, the assumption of character was in all
three cases identical.&nbsp; As to style, he was only too anxious to
meet (and, he doubted not, to beat) on his own ground any antagonist
whose ear had begotten <a name="citation291"></a><a href="#footnote291">{291}</a>
the crude and untenable theory that the Hamlet soliloquies were not
distinctly within the range of the man who could produce those of Crites
and of Macilente in <i>Cynthia&rsquo;s Revels</i> and <i>Every Man out
of his Humour</i>.&nbsp; The author of those soliloquies could, and
did, in the parallel passages of <i>Hamlet</i>, rise near the height
of the master he honoured and loved.</p>
<p>The further discussion of this subject was reserved for the next
meeting of the Society, as was also the reading of Mr. H.&rsquo;s paper
on the subsequent quarrel between the two joint authors of Hamlet, which
led to Jonson&rsquo;s caricature of Shakespeare (then retired from London
society to a country life of solitude) under the name of Morose, and
to Shakespeare&rsquo;s retort on Jonson, who was no less evidently attacked
under the designation of Ariel.&nbsp; The allusions to the subject of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets in the courtship and marriage of Epic&oelig;ne
by Morose were as obvious as the allusions in the part of Ariel to the
repeated incarceration of Jonson, first on a criminal and secondly on
a political charge, and to his probable release in the former case (during
the reign of Elizabeth=Sycorax) at the intercession of Shakespeare,
who was allowed on all hands to have represented himself in the character
of Prospero (&ldquo;it was mine art that let thee out&rdquo;).&nbsp;
Mr. I. would afterwards read a paper on the evidence for Shakespeare&rsquo;s
whole or part authorship of a dozen or so of the least known plays of
his time, which, besides having various words and phrases in common
with his acknowledged works, were obviously too bad to be attributed
to any other known writer of the period.&nbsp; Eminent among these was
the tragedy of <i>Andromana, or the Merchant&rsquo;s Wife</i>, long
since rejected from the list of Shirley&rsquo;s works as unworthy of
that poet&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Unquestionably it was so; not less unworthy
than <i>A Larum for London</i> of Marlowe&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The consequent
inference that it must needs be the work of the new Shakespeare&rsquo;s
was surely no less cogent in this than in the former case.&nbsp; The
allusion occurring in it to a play bearing date just twenty-six years
after the death of Shakespeare, and written by a poet then unborn, was
a strong point in favour of his theory.&nbsp; (This argument was received
with general marks of adhesion.)&nbsp; What, he would ask, could be
more natural than that Shirley when engaged on the revision and arrangement
for the stage of this posthumous work of the new Shakespeare&rsquo;s
(a fact which could require no further proof than he had already adduced),
should have inserted this reference in order to disguise the name of
its real author, and protect it from the disfavour of an audience with
whom that name was notoriously out of fashion?&nbsp; This reasoning,
conclusive in itself, became even more irresistible&mdash;or would become
so, if that were anything less than an absolute impossibility&mdash;on
comparison of parallel passages,</p>
<blockquote><p>Though kings still hug suspicion in their bosoms,<br />
They hate the causer.&nbsp; (<i>Andromana</i>, Act i. Sc. 3.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare this with the avowal put by Shakespeare into the mouth of
a king.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though
I did wish him dead<br />
I hate the murderer.&nbsp; (<i>King Richard II</i>., Act v. Sc.&nbsp;
6.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again in the same scene:</p>
<blockquote><p>For then her husband comes home from the Rialto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare this with various passages (too familiar to quote) in the
<i>Merchant of Venice</i>.&nbsp; The transference of the Rialto to Iberia
was of a piece with the discovery of a sea-coast in Bohemia.&nbsp; In
the same scene Andromana says to her lover, finding him reluctant to
take his leave, almost in the very words of Romeo to Juliet,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then let us stand
and outface danger,<br />
Since you will have it so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was obvious that only the author of the one passage could have
thought it necessary to disguise his plagiarism in the other by an inversion
of sexes between the two speakers.&nbsp; In the same scene were three
other indisputable instances of repetition.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mariners might with
far greater ease<br />
Hear whole shoals of sirens singing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare <i>Comedy of Errors</i>, Act iii. Scene 2.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sing, siren, for thyself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case identity of sex was as palpable an evidence for identity
of authorship as diversity of sex had afforded in the preceding instance.</p>
<p>Again:</p>
<blockquote><p>Have oaths no <i>more validity</i> with princes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Act iii. Scene 3, the very same words
were coupled in the very same order:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>More
validity</i>,<br />
More honourable state, more courtship lies<br />
In carrion flies than Romeo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again:</p>
<blockquote><p>It would have killed a salamander.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare the <i>First Part of King Henry IV</i>, Act iii. Scene 3.</p>
<blockquote><p>I have maintained that salamander of yours with fire
any time this two and thirty years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Act ii. Scene 2 the hero, on being informed how heavy are the
odds against him in the field, answers,</p>
<blockquote><p>I am glad on&rsquo;t; the honour is the greater.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which his confidant rejoins:</p>
<blockquote><p>The danger is the greater.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in the sixth scene of the same act the messenger observes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only heard the
prince wish<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.<br />
He had fewer by a thousand men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could any member doubt that we had here the same hand which gave
us the like debate between King Henry and Westmoreland on the eve of
Agincourt? or could any member suppose that in the subsequent remark
of the same military confidant, &ldquo;I smell a rat, sir,&rdquo; there
was merely a fortuitous coincidence with Hamlet&rsquo;s reflection as
he &ldquo;whips out his rapier&rdquo;&mdash;in itself a martial proceeding&mdash;under
similar circumstances to the same effect?</p>
<p>In the very next scene a captain observes of his own troops</p>
<blockquote><p>Methinks such tattered rogues should never conquer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a touch that could only be due to the pencil which had drawn Falstaff&rsquo;s
ragged regiment.&nbsp; In both cases, moreover, it was to be noted that
the tattered rogues proved ultimately victorious.&nbsp; But he had&mdash;they
might hardly believe it, but so it was&mdash;even yet stronger and more
convincing evidence to offer.&nbsp; It would be remembered that a play
called <i>The Double Falsehood</i>, formerly attributed to Shakespeare
on the authority of Theobald, was now generally supposed to have been
in its original form the work of Shirley.&nbsp; What, then, he would
ask, could be more natural or more probable than that a play formerly
ascribed to Shirley should prove to be the genuine work of Shakespeare?&nbsp;
Common sense, common reason, common logic, all alike and all equally
combined to enforce upon every candid judgment this inevitable conclusion.&nbsp;
This, however, was nothing in comparison to the final proof which he
had yet to lay before them.&nbsp; He need not remind them that in the
opinion of their illustrious German teachers, the first men to discover
and reveal to his unworthy countrymen the very existence of the new
Shakespeare, the authenticity of any play ascribed to the possibly too
prolific pen of that poet was invariably to be determined in the last
resort by consideration of its demerits.&nbsp; No English critic, therefore,
who felt himself worthy to have been born a German, would venture to
question the postulate on which all sound principles of criticism with
regard to this subject must infallibly be founded: that, given any play
of unknown or doubtful authorship, the worse it was, the likelier was
it to be Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; (This proposition was received with
every sign of unanimous assent.)&nbsp; Now, on this ground he was prepared
to maintain that the claims of <i>Andromana</i> to their most respectful,
their most cordial, their most unhesitating acceptance were absolutely
beyond all possibility of parallel.&nbsp; Not <i>Mucedorus</i> or <i>Fair
Em</i>, not <i>The Birth of Merlin</i> or <i>Thomas Lord Cromwell</i>,
could reasonably or fairly be regarded as on the same level of worthlessness
with this incomparable production.&nbsp; No mortal man who had survived
its perusal could for a moment hesitate to agree that it was the most
incredibly, ineffably, inconceivably, unmitigatedly, irredeemably, inexpressibly
damnable piece of bad work ever perpetrated by human hand.&nbsp; No
mortal critic of the genuine Anglo-German school could therefore hesitate
for a moment to agree that in common consistency he was bound to accept
it as the possible work of no human hand but the hand of the New Shakespeare.</p>
<p>The Chairman then proceeded to recapitulate the work done and the
benefits conferred by the Society during the twelve months which had
elapsed since its foundation on that day (April 1st) last year.&nbsp;
They had ample reason to congratulate themselves and him on the result.&nbsp;
They had established an entirely new kind of criticism, working by entirely
new means towards an entirely new end, in honour of an entirely new
kind of Shakespeare.&nbsp; They had proved to demonstration and overwhelmed
with obloquy the incompetence, the imbecility, the untrustworthiness,
the blunders, the forgeries, the inaccuracies, the obliquities, the
utter moral and literary worthlessness, of previous students and societies.&nbsp;
They had revealed to the world at large the generally prevalent ignorance
of Shakespeare and his works which so discreditably distinguished his
countrymen.&nbsp; This they had been enabled to do by the simple process
of putting forward various theories, and still more various facts, but
all of equally incontrovertible value and relevance, of which no Englishman&mdash;he
might say, no mortal&mdash;outside the Society had ever heard or dreamed
till now.&nbsp; They had discovered the one trustworthy and indisputable
method, so easy and so simple that it must now seem wonderful it should
never have been discovered before, by which to pluck out the heart of
the poet&rsquo;s mystery and detect the secret of his touch; the study
of Shakespeare by rule of thumb.&nbsp; Every man, woman, and child born
with five fingers on each hand was henceforward better qualified as
a critic than any poet or scholar of time past.&nbsp; But it was not,
whatever outsiders might pretend to think, exclusively on the verse-test,
as it had facetiously been called on account of its total incompatibility
with any conceivable scheme of metre or principle of rhythm&mdash;it
was not exclusively on this precious and unanswerable test that they
relied.&nbsp; Within the Society as well as without, the pretensions
of those who would acknowledge no other means of deciding on debated
questions had been refuted and repelled.&nbsp; What were the other means
of investigation and verification in which not less than in the metrical
test they were accustomed to put their faith, and by which they doubted
not to attain in the future even more remarkable results than their
researches had as yet achieved, the debate just concluded, in common
with every other for which they ever had met or ever were likely to
meet, would amply suffice to show.&nbsp; By such processes as had been
applied on this as on all occasions to the text of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
works and the traditions of his life, they trusted in a very few years
to subvert all theories which had hitherto been held and extirpate all
ideas which had hitherto been cherished on the subject: and having thus
cleared the ground for his advent, to discover for the admiration of
the world, as the name of their Society implied, a New Shakespeare.&nbsp;
The first step towards this end must of course be the demolition of
the old one; and he would venture to say they had already made a good
beginning in that direction.&nbsp; They had disproved or they would
disprove the claim of Shakespeare to the sole authorship of <i>Macbeth,
Julius C&aelig;sar, King Lear, Hamlet</i>, and <i>Othello</i>; they
had established or they would establish the fact of his partnership
in <i>Locrine, Mucedorus, The Birth of Merlin, Dr. Dodipoll</i>, and
<i>Sir Giles Goosecap</i>.&nbsp; They had with them the incomparable
critics of Germany; men whose knowledge and judgment on all questions
of English literature were as far beyond the reach of their English
followers as the freedom and enlightenment enjoyed by the subjects of
a military empire were beyond the reach of the citizens of a democratic
republic.&nbsp; They had established and affiliated to their own primitive
body or church various branch societies or sects, in England and elsewhere,
devoted to the pursuit of the same end by the same means and method
of study as had just been exemplified in the transactions of the present
meeting.&nbsp; Still there remained much to be done; in witness of which
he proposed to lay before them at their next meeting, by way of inauguration
under a happy omen of their new year&rsquo;s work, the complete body
of evidence by means of which he was prepared to demonstrate that some
considerable portion, if not the greater part, of the remaining plays
hitherto assigned to Shakespeare was due to the collaboration of a contemporary
actor and playwright, well known by name, but hitherto insufficiently
appreciated; Robert Armin, the author of <i>A Nest of Ninnies</i>.</p>
<h3>ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS.</h3>
<p>The humble but hard-working journeyman of letters who was charged
with the honourable duty of reporting the transactions at the last meeting
of the Newest Shakespeare Society on the auspicious occasion of its
first anniversary, April 1st, has received sundry more or less voluminous
communications from various gentlemen whose papers were then read or
announced, pointing out with more or less acrimonious commentary the
matters on which it seems to them severally that they have cause to
complain of imperfection or inaccuracy in his conscientious and painstaking
report.&nbsp; Anxious above all things to secure for himself such credit
as may be due to the modest merit of scrupulous fidelity, he desires
to lay before the public so much of the corrections conveyed in their
respective letters of reclamation as may be necessary to complete or
to rectify the first draught of their propositions as conveyed in his
former summary.&nbsp; On the present occasion, however, he must confine
himself to forwarding the rectifications supplied by two of the members
who took a leading part in the debate of April 1st.</p>
<p>The necessarily condensed report of Mr. A.&rsquo;s paper on <i>A
Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i> may make the reasoning put forward
by that gentleman liable to the misconception of a hasty reader.&nbsp;
The omission of various qualifying phrases has left his argument without
such explanation, his statements without such reservation, as he had
been careful to supply.&nbsp; He did not say in so many words that he
had been disposed to assign this drama to the author of <i>The Revenger&rsquo;s
Tragedy</i> simply on the score of the affinity discernible between
the subjects of the two plays.&nbsp; He is not prone to self-confidence
or to indulgence in paradox.&nbsp; What he did say was undeniable by
any but those who trusted only to their ear, and refused to correct
the conclusions thus arrived at by the help of other organs which God
had given them&mdash;their fingers, for example, and their toes; by
means of which a critic of trained and competent scholarship might with
the utmost confidence count up as far as twenty, to the great profit
of all students who were willing to accept his guidance and be bound
by his decision on matters of art and poetry.&nbsp; Only the most purblind
could fail to observe, what only the most perverse could hesitate to
admit, that there was at first sight an obvious connection between the
poison-flower&mdash;&ldquo;purple from love&rsquo;s wound&rdquo;&mdash;squeezed
by Oberon into the eyes of the sleeping Titania and the poison rubbed
by Vindice upon the skull of the murdered Gloriana.&nbsp; No student
of Ulrici&rsquo;s invaluable work would think this a far-fetched reference.&nbsp;
That eminent critic had verified the meaning and detected the allusion
underlying many a passage of Shakespeare in which the connection of
moral idea was more difficult to establish than this.&nbsp; In the fifth
act of either play there was a masque or dramatic show of a sanguinary
kind; in the one case the bloodshed was turned to merry-making, in the
other the merry-making was turned to bloodshed.&nbsp; Oberon&rsquo;s
phrase, &ldquo;till I torment thee for this injury,&rdquo; might easily
be mistaken for a quotation from the part of Vindice.&nbsp; This explanation,
he trusted, would suffice to exonerate his original view from any charge
of haste or rashness; especially as he had now completely given it up,
and adopted one (if possible) more impregnably based on internal and
external evidence.</p>
<p>Mr. C. was not unnaturally surprised and indignant to find his position
as to Romeo and Lord Burghley barely indicated, and the notice given
of the arguments by which it was supported so docked and curtailed as
to convey a most inadequate conception of their force.&nbsp; Among the
chief points of his argument were these: that the forsaken Rosaline
was evidently intended for the late Queen Mary, during whose reign Cecil
had notoriously conformed to the observances of her creed, though ready
on the accession of Elizabeth to throw it overboard at a day&rsquo;s
notice; (it was not to be overlooked that the friar on first hearing
the announcement of this change of faith is made earnestly to remonstrate,
prefacing his reproaches with an invocation of two sacred names&mdash;an
invocation peculiar to Catholics;) that the resemblance between old
Capulet and Henry VIII. is obvious to the most careless reader; his
oath of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s bread!&rdquo; immediately followed by the
avowal &ldquo;it makes me mad&rdquo; is an unmistakable allusion to
the passions excited by the eucharistic controversy; his violence towards
Juliet at the end of the third act at once suggests the alienation of
her father&rsquo;s heart from the daughter of Anne Boleyn; the self-congratulation
on her own &ldquo;stainless&rdquo; condition as a virgin expressed by
Juliet in soliloquy (Act iii. Sc. 2) while in the act of awaiting her
bridegroom conveys a furtive stroke of satire at the similar vaunt of
Elizabeth when likewise meditating marriage and preparing to receive
a suitor from the hostile house of Valois.&nbsp; It must be unnecessary
to point out the resemblance or rather the identity between the character
and fortune of Paris and the character and fortune of Essex, whose fate
had been foreseen and whose end prefigured by the poet with almost prophetic
sagacity.&nbsp; To the far-reaching eye of Shakespeare it must have
seemed natural and inevitable that Paris (Essex) should fall by the
hand of Romeo (Burghley) immediately before the monument of the Capulets
where their common mistress was interred alive&mdash;immediately, that
is, before the termination of the Tudor dynasty in the person of Elizabeth,
who towards the close of her reign may fitly have been regarded as one
already buried with her fathers, though yet living in a state of suspended
animation under the influence of a deadly narcotic potion administered
by the friends of Romeo&mdash;by the partisans, that is, of the Cecilian
policy.&nbsp; The Nurse was not less evidently designed to represent
the Established Church.&nbsp; Allusions to the marriage of the clergy
are profusely scattered through her speeches.&nbsp; Her deceased husband
was probably meant for Sir Thomas More&mdash;&ldquo;a merry man&rdquo;
to the last moment of his existence&mdash;who might well be supposed
by a slight poetic license to have foreseen in the infancy of Elizabeth
her future backsliding and fall from the straight path &ldquo;when she
came to age.&rdquo;&nbsp; The passing expression of tenderness with
which the Nurse refers to his memory&mdash;&ldquo;God be with his soul!&rdquo;&mdash;implies
at once the respect in which the name of the martyr Chancellor was still
generally held, and the lingering remains of Catholic tradition which
still made a prayer for the dead rise naturally to Anglican lips.&nbsp;
On the other hand, the strife between Anglicans and Puritans, the struggle
of episcopalian with Calvinistic reformers, was quite as plainly typified
in the quarrel between the Nurse and Mercutio, in which the Martin Marprelate
controversy was first unmistakably represented on the stage.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;saucy merchant, that was so full of his ropery,&rdquo; with his
ridicule of the &ldquo;stale&rdquo; practice of Lenten fasting and abstinence,
his contempt for &ldquo;a Lenten pie,&rdquo; and his preference for
a flesh diet as &ldquo;very good meat in Lent,&rdquo; is clearly a disciple
of Calvin; and the impotence of the Nurse, however scandalised at the
nakedness of his ribald profanity, to protect herself against it by
appeal to reason or tradition, is dwelt upon with an emphasis sufficient
to indicate the secret tendency of the poet&rsquo;s own sympathies and
convictions.&nbsp; In Romeo&rsquo;s attempt at conciliation, and his
poor excuse for Mercutio (which yet the Nurse, an emblem of the temporising
and accommodating pliancy of episcopalian Protestantism, shows herself
only too ready to accept as valid) as &ldquo;one that God hath made,
for himself to mar,&rdquo;&mdash;the allusion here is evidently to the
democratic and revolutionary tendencies of the doctrine of Knox and
Calvin, with its ultimate developments of individualism and private
judgment&mdash;we recognise the note of Burghley&rsquo;s lifelong policy
and its endeavour to fuse the Protestant or Puritan party with the state
Church of the Tudors as by law established.&nbsp; The distaste of Elizabeth&rsquo;s
bishops for such advances, their flutter of apprehension at the daring
and their burst of indignation at the insolence of the Calvinists, are
significantly expressed in terms which seem to hint at a possible return
for help and protection to the shelter of the older faith and the support
of its partisans.&nbsp; &ldquo;An &rsquo;a speak anything against me,
I&rsquo;ll take him down an &rsquo;a were lustier than he is, and twenty
such Jacks;&rdquo; (the allusion here is again obvious, to the baptismal
name of John Calvin and John Knox, if not also to the popular byword
of Jack Presbyter;) &ldquo;and if I cannot,&rdquo; (here the sense of
insecurity and dependence on foreign help or secular power becomes transparent)
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find those that shall.&rdquo;&nbsp; She disclaims
communion with the Protestant Churches of the continent, with Amsterdam
or Geneva: &ldquo;I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Peter, who carries her fan (&ldquo;to hide her face: for her fan&rsquo;s
the fairer face&rdquo;; we may take this to be a symbol of the form
of episcopal consecration still retained in the Anglican Church as a
cover for its separation from Catholicism), is undoubtedly meant for
Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury; the name Peter, as applied to a
menial who will stand by and suffer every knave to use the Church at
his pleasure, but is ready to draw as soon as another man if only he
may be sure of having the secular arm of the law on his side, implies
a bitter sarcasm on the intruding official of state then established
by law as occupant of a see divorced from its connection with that of
the apostle.&nbsp; The sense of instability natural to an institution
which is compelled to rely for support on ministers who are themselves
dependent on the state whose pay they draw for power to strike a blow
in self-defence could hardly be better expressed than by the solemn
and piteous, almost agonised asseveration; &ldquo;Now, afore God, I
am so vexed, that every part about me quivers.&rdquo;&nbsp; To Shakespeare,
it cannot be doubted, the impending dissolution or dislocation of the
Anglican system in &ldquo;every part&rdquo; by civil war and religious
discord must even then have been but too ominously evident.</p>
<p>If further confirmation could be needed of the underlying significance
of allusion traceable throughout this play, it might amply be supplied
by fresh reference to the first scene in which the Nurse makes her appearance
on the stage, and is checked by Lady Capulet in the full tide of affectionate
regret for her lost husband.&nbsp; We can well imagine Anne Boleyn cutting
short the regrets of some indiscreet courtier for Sir Thomas More in
the very words of the text;</p>
<blockquote><p>Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;parlous knock&rdquo; which left so big a lump upon the
brow of the infant Juliet is evidently an allusion to the declaration
of Elizabeth&rsquo;s illegitimacy while yet in her cradle.&nbsp; The
seal of bastardy set upon the baby brow of</p>
<p>Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s daughter may well be said to have &ldquo;broken&rdquo;

<p>The counsel of the Nurse to Juliet in Act iii. Scene 5 to forsake
Romeo for Paris indicates the bias of the hierarchy in favour of Essex&mdash;&ldquo;a
lovely gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;rather than of the ultra-Protestant policy
of Burghley, who doubtless in the eyes of courtiers and churchmen was
&ldquo;a dish-clout to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were a few of the points, set down at random, which he had
been enabled to verify within the limits of a single play.&nbsp; They
would suffice to give an idea of the process by which, when applied
in detail to every one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, he trusted to establish
the secret history and import of each, not less than the general sequence
and significance of all.&nbsp; Further instalments of this work would
probably be issued in the forthcoming or future Transactions of the
Newest Shakespeare Society; and it was confidently expected that the
final monument of his research when thoroughly completed and illustrated
by copious appendices, would prove as worthy as any work of mere English
scholarship could hope to be of a place beside the inestimable commentaries
of Gervinus, Ulrici, and the Polypseudocriticopantodapomorosophisticometricoglossematographicomaniacal

<p>CHIM&AElig;RA BOMBINANS IN VACUO.</p>
<h4>NOTE.</h4>
<p>Mindful of the good old apologue regarding &ldquo;the squeak of the
real pig,&rdquo; I think it here worth while to certify the reader of
little faith, that the more incredibly impudent absurdities above cited
are not so much or so often the freaks of parody or the fancies of burlesque
as select excerpts and transcripts of printed and published utterances
from the &ldquo;pink soft litter&rdquo; of a living brood&mdash;from
the reports of an actual Society, issued in an abridged and doubtless
an emasculated form through the columns of a weekly newspaper.&nbsp;
One final and unapproachable instance, one transcendant and pyramidal
example of classical taste and of critical scholarship, I did not venture
to impair by transference from those columns and transplantation into
these pages among humbler specimens of minor monstrosity.&nbsp; Let
it stand here once more on record as &ldquo;a good jest for ever&rdquo;&mdash;or
rather as the best and therefore as the worst, as the worst and therefore
as the best, of all possible bad jests ever to be cracked between this
and the crack of doom.&nbsp; Sophocles, said a learned member, was the
proper parallel to Shakespeare among the ancient tragedians: &AElig;schylus&mdash;hear,
O heaven, and give ear, O earth!&mdash;<i>&AElig;schylus was only a
Marlowe</i>.</p>
<p>The hand which here transcribes this most transcendant utterance
has written before now many lines in verse and in prose to the honour
and glory of Christopher Marlowe: it has never&mdash;be the humble avowal
thus blushingly recorded&mdash;it has never set down as the writer&rsquo;s
opinion that he was only an &AElig;schylus.&nbsp; In other words, it
has never registered as my deliberate and judicial verdict the finding
that he was only the equal of the greatest among all tragic and all
prophetic poets; of the man who combined all the light of the Greeks
with all the fire of the Hebrews; who varied at his will the revelation
of the single gift of Isaiah with the display of the mightiest among
the manifold gifts of Shakespeare.</p>

by Dr. Grosart in his beautiful and valuable edition of Greene&rsquo;s
works.</p>
<p><a name="footnote33"></a><a href="#citation33">{33}</a>&nbsp; One
thing is certain: that damnable last scene at which the gorge rises
even to remember it is in execution as unlike the crudest phase of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
style as in conception it is unlike the idlest birth of his spirit.&nbsp;
Let us hope that so foul a thing could not have been done in even tolerably
good verse.</p>
<p><a name="footnote42"></a><a href="#citation42">{42}</a>&nbsp; It
is not the least of Lord Macaulay&rsquo;s offences against art that
he should have contributed the temporary weight of his influence as
a critic to the support of so ignorant and absurd a tradition of criticism
as that which classes the great writer here mentioned with the brutal
if &ldquo;brawny&rdquo; Wycherley&mdash;a classification almost to be
paralleled with that which in the days of our fathers saw fit to couple
together the names of Balzac and of Sue.&nbsp; Any competent critic
will always recognise in <i>The Way of the World</i> one of the glories,
in <i>The Country Wife</i> one of the disgraces, of dramatic and of
English literature.&nbsp; The stains discernible on the masterpiece
of Congreve are trivial and conventional; the mere conception of the
other man&rsquo;s work displays a mind so prurient and leprous, uncovers
such an unfathomable and unimaginable beastliness of imagination, that
in the present age at least he would probably have figured as a virtuous
journalist and professional rebuker of poetic vice or artistic aberration.</p>
<p><a name="footnote63"></a><a href="#citation63">{63}</a>&nbsp; Since
this passage first went to press, I have received from Dr. Grosart the
most happy news that he has procured a perfect copy of this precious
volume, and will shortly add it to his occasional issues of golden waifs
and strays forgotten by the ebb-tide of time.&nbsp; Not even the disinterment
of Robert Chester&rsquo;s &ldquo;glorified&rdquo; poem, with its appended
jewels of verse from Shakespeare&rsquo;s very hand and from others only
less great than Shakespeare&rsquo;s, all now at last reset in their
strange original framework, was a gift of greater price than this.</p>
<p><a name="footnote89"></a><a href="#citation89">{89}</a>&nbsp; Compare
with Beaumont&rsquo;s admirable farce of Bessus the wretched imitation
of it attempted after his death in the <i>Nice Valour</i> of Fletcher;
whose proper genius was neither for pure tragedy nor broad farce, but
for high comedy and heroic romance&mdash;a field of his own invention;
witness <i>Monsieur Thomas</i> and <i>The Knight of Malta</i>: while
Beaumont has approved himself in tragedy all but the worthiest disciple
of Shakespeare, in farce beyond all comparison the aptest pupil of Jonson.&nbsp;
He could give us no <i>Fox</i> or <i>Alchemist</i>; but the inventor
of Bessus and Calianax was worthy of the esteem and affection returned
to him by the creator of Morose and Rabbi Busy.</p>
<p><a name="footnote92"></a><a href="#citation92">{92}</a>&nbsp; A desperate
attempt has been made to support the metrical argument in favour of
Fletcher&rsquo;s authorship by the production of a list in which such
words as <i>slavery, emperor, pitying, difference</i>, and even <i>Christians</i>,
were actually registered as trisyllabic terminations.&nbsp; To such
unimaginable shifts are critics of the finger-counting or syllabic school
inevitably and fatally reduced in the effort to establish by rule of
thumb even so much as may seem verifiable by that rule in the province
of poetical criticism.&nbsp; Prosody is at best no more than the skeleton
of verse, as verse is the body of poetry; while the gain of such painful
labourers in a field they know not how to till is not even a skeleton
of worthless or irrelevant fact, but the shadow of such a skeleton reflected
in water.&nbsp; It would seem that critics who hear only through their
fingers have not even fingers to hear with.</p>

Possibly some readers may agree with my second thoughts, in thinking
that one exception may here be made and some surprise be here expressed
at Shakespeare&rsquo;s rejection of Sly&rsquo;s memorable query&mdash;&ldquo;When
will the fool come again, Sim?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is true that he could
well afford to spare it, as what could he not well afford to spare?
but I will confess that it seems to me worthy of a place among his own
Sly&rsquo;s most admirable and notable sallies of humour.</p>

In a later part of his noble and invaluable work (vol. iii. p.188) the
author quotes a passage from &ldquo;the induction to <i>A Warning for
Fair Women</i>, 1599 (to which Shakespeare most assuredly contributed).&rdquo;&nbsp;
It will be seen that I do not shrink from admitting the full weight
of authority which can be thrown into the scale against my own opinion.&nbsp;
To such an assertion from the insolent organs of pretentious ignorance
I should be content with the simple rejoinder that Shakespeare most
assuredly did nothing whatever of the sort; but to return such an answer
in the present case would be to write myself down&mdash;and that in
company to which I should most emphatically object&mdash;as something
very decidedly more&mdash;and worse&mdash;than an ass.</p>
<p><a name="footnote137"></a><a href="#citation137">{137}</a>&nbsp;
Not for the first and probably not for the last time I turn, with all
confidence as with all reverence, for illustration and confirmation
of my own words, to the exquisite critical genius of a long honoured
and long lamented fellow-craftsman.&nbsp; The following admirable and
final estimate of the more special element or peculiar quality in the
intellectual force of Honor&eacute; de Balzac could only have been taken
by the inevitable intuition and rendered by the subtlest eloquence of
Charles Baudelaire.&nbsp; Nothing could more aptly and perfectly illustrate
the distinction indicated in my text between unimaginative realism and
imaginative reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have many a time been astonished that to pass for an observer
should be Balzac&rsquo;s great popular title to fame.&nbsp; To me it
had always seemed that it was his chief merit to be a visionary, and
a passionate visionary.&nbsp; All his characters are gifted with the
ardour of life which animated himself.&nbsp; All his fictions are as
deeply coloured as dreams.&nbsp; From the highest of the aristocracy
to the lowest of the mob, all the actors in his <i>Human Comedy</i>
are keener after living, more active and cunning in their struggles,
more staunch in endurance of misfortune, more ravenous in enjoyment,
more angelic in devotion, than the comedy of the real world shows them
to us.&nbsp; In a word, every one in Balzac, down to the very scullions,
has genius.&nbsp; Every mind is a weapon loaded to the muzzle with will.&nbsp;
It is actually Balzac himself.&nbsp; And as all the beings of the outer
world presented themselves to his mind&rsquo;s eye in strong relief
and with a telling expression, he has given a convulsive action to his
figures; he has blackened their shadows and intensified their lights.&nbsp;
Besides, his prodigious love of detail, the outcome of an immoderate
ambition to see everything, to bring everything to sight, to guess everything,
to make others guess everything, obliged him to set down more forcibly
the principal lines, so as to preserve the perspective of the whole.&nbsp;
He reminds me sometimes of those etchers who are never satisfied with
the biting-in of their outlines, and transform into very ravines the
main scratches of the plate.&nbsp; From this astonishing natural disposition
of mind wonderful results have been produced.&nbsp; But this disposition
is generally defined as Balzac&rsquo;s great fault.&nbsp; More properly
speaking, it is exactly his great distinctive duality.&nbsp; But who
can boast of being so happily gifted, and of being able to apply a method
which may permit him to invest&mdash;and that with a sure hand&mdash;what
is purely trivial with splendour and imperial purple?&nbsp; Who can
do this?&nbsp; Now, he who does not, to speak the truth, does no great
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was any very great thing done by the author of <i>A Warning for
Fair Women</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote141"></a><a href="#citation141">{141}</a>&nbsp;
I do not know or remember in the whole radiant range of Elizabethan
drama more than one parallel tribute to that paid in this play by an
English poet to the yet foreign art of painting, through the eloquent
mouth of this enthusiastic villain of genius, whom we might regard as
a more genuinely Titianic sort of Wainwright.&nbsp; The parallel passage
is that most lovely and fervid of all imaginative panegyrics on this
art, extracted by Lamb from the comedy of <i>Doctor Dodipoll</i>; which
saw the light or twilight of publication just eight years later than
<i>Arden of Feversham</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote154"></a><a href="#citation154">{154}</a>&nbsp;
I remember to have somewhere at some time fallen in with some remark
by some commentator to some such effect as this: that it would be somewhat
difficult to excuse the unwomanly violence of this demand.&nbsp; Doubtless
it would.&nbsp; And doubtless it would be somewhat more than difficult
to extenuate the unmaidenly indelicacy of Jeanne Darc.</p>
<p><a name="footnote179"></a><a href="#citation179">{179}</a>&nbsp;
What would at least be partly lust in another man is all but purely
hatred in Iago.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now
I do love her too:<br />
Not out of absolute lust, (though, peradventure,<br />
I stand accountant for as great a sin)<br />
But partly led to diet my revenge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For &ldquo;partly&rdquo; read &ldquo;wholly,&rdquo; and for &ldquo;peradventure&rdquo;
read &ldquo;assuredly,&rdquo; and the incarnate father of lies, made
manifest in the flesh, here speaks all but all the truth for once, to
himself alone.</p>
<p><a name="footnote205"></a><a href="#citation205">{205}</a>&nbsp;
I add the proof in a footnote, so as to take up no more than a small
necessary space of my text with the establishment of a fact which yet
can seem insignificant to no mortal who has a human ear for lyric song.&nbsp;
Shakespeare&rsquo;s verse, as all the wide world knows, ends thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>But my kisses bring again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bring again,<br />
Seals of love, but sealed in vain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sealed in vain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The echo has been dropped by Fletcher, who has thus achieved the
remarkable musical feat of turning a nightingale&rsquo;s note into a
sparrow&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The mutilation of Philomela by the hands of Tereus
was a jest compared to the mutilation of Shakespeare by the hands of
Fletcher: who thereby reduced the close of the first verse into agreement
if not into accordance with the close of his own.&nbsp; This appended
verse, as all the world does not and need not know, ends thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>But first set my poor heart free,<br />
Bound in those icy chains by thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even an earless owner of fingers enough to count on may by their
help convince himself of the difference in metre here.&nbsp; But not
only does the last line, with unsolicited and literally superfluous
liberality, offer us a syllable over measure; the words are such as
absolutely to defy antiphonal repetition or reverberation of the three
last in either line.&nbsp; Let us therefore, like good scriptural scholars,
according equally to the letter and the spirit of the text, render unto
Fletcher the things which be Fletcher&rsquo;s, and unto Shakespeare
the things which be Shakespeare&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><a name="footnote210"></a><a href="#citation210">{210}</a>&nbsp;
It is worth remark that in a still older sample of an older and ruder
form of play than can have been the very earliest mould in which the
pristine or pre-Shakespearean model of <i>Pericles</i> was cast, the
part of Chorus here assigned to Gower was filled by a representative
of his fellow-poet Lydgate.</p>
<p><a name="footnote217"></a><a href="#citation217">{217}</a>&nbsp;
Except perhaps one little word of due praise for the pretty imitation
or recollection of his dead friend Beaumont rather than of Shakespeare,
in the description of the crazed girl whose &ldquo;careless tresses
a wreath of bullrush rounded&rdquo; where she sat playing with flowers
for emblems at a game of love and sorrow&mdash;but liker in all else
to Bellario by another fountain-side than to Ophelia by the brook of
death.</p>
<p><a name="footnote220"></a><a href="#citation220">{220}</a>&nbsp;
On the 17th of September, 1864.</p>
<p><a name="footnote232"></a><a href="#citation232">{232}</a>&nbsp;
The once too celebrated crime which in this play was exhibited on the
public stage with the forcible fidelity of a wellnigh brutal realism
took actual place on the private stage of fact in the year 1604.&nbsp;
Four years afterwards the play was published as Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Eight years more, and Shakespeare was with &AElig;schylus.</p>
<p><a name="footnote237"></a><a href="#citation237">{237}</a>&nbsp;
Written in 1879.</p>
<p><a name="footnote239"></a><a href="#citation239">{239}</a>&nbsp;
Capell has altered this to &ldquo;proud perfumes&rdquo;; marking the
change in a note, with the scrupulous honesty which would seem to have
usually distinguished him from more daring and more famous editors.</p>
<p><a name="footnote245a"></a><a href="#citation245a">{245a}</a>&nbsp;
The feeble archaic inversion in this line is one among many small signs
which all together suffice, if not to throw back the date of this play
to the years immediately preceding the advent of Marlowe or the full
influence of his genius and example, yet certainly to mark it as an
instance of survival from that period of incomposite and inadequate
workmanship in verse.</p>
<p><a name="footnote245b"></a><a href="#citation245b">{245b}</a>&nbsp;
Or than this play to a genuine work of Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brick
to coral&rdquo;&mdash;these three words describe exactly the difference
in tone and shade of literary colour.</p>
<p><a name="footnote246"></a><a href="#citation246">{246}</a>&nbsp;
Here for the first time we come upon a verse not unworthy of Marlowe
himself&mdash;a verse in spirit as in cadence recalling the deep oceanic
reverberations of his &ldquo;mighty line,&rdquo; profound and just and
simple and single as a note of the music of the sea.&nbsp; But it would
be hard if a devout and studious disciple were never to catch one passing
tone of his master&rsquo;s habitual accent.&mdash;It may be worth while
to observe that we find here the same modulation of verse&mdash;common
enough since then, but new to the patient auditors of <i>Gorboduc</i>
and <i>Locrine</i>&mdash;which we find in the finest passage of Marlowe&rsquo;s
imperfect play of <i>Dido</i>, completed by Nash after the young Master&rsquo;s
untimely death.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why star&rsquo;st thou in my face?&nbsp; If thou wilt
stay,<br />
Leap in my arms: mine arms are open wide:<br />
If not&mdash;turn from me, and I&rsquo;ll turn from thee;<br />
For though thou hast the power to say farewell,<br />
I have not power to stay thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we may look long in vain for the like of this passage, taken
from the crudest and feeblest work of Marlowe, in the wide and wordy
expanse of <i>King Edward III</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote247"></a><a href="#citation247">{247}</a>&nbsp;
A pre-Shakespearean word of single occurrence in a single play of Shakespeare&rsquo;s,
and proper to the academic school of playwrights.</p>
<p><a name="footnote248"></a><a href="#citation248">{248}</a>&nbsp;
<i>The First Part of Tamburlaine the Great</i>, Act v. Sc. ii.</p>
<p><a name="footnote252"></a><a href="#citation252">{252}</a>&nbsp;
It may be worth a remark that the word <i>power</i> is constantly used
as a dissyllable; another note of archaic debility or insufficiency
in metre.</p>
<p><a name="footnote255"></a><a href="#citation255">{255}</a>&nbsp;
Yet another essentially non-Shakespearean word, though doubtless once
used by Shakespeare; this time a most ungraceful Gallicism.</p>
<p><a name="footnote256"></a><a href="#citation256">{256}</a>&nbsp;
It may obviate any chance of mistake if I observe that here as elsewhere,
when I mention the name that is above every name in English literature,
I refer to the old Shakespeare, and not to &ldquo;the new Shakspere&rdquo;;
a <i>novus homo</i> with whom I have no acquaintance, and with whom
(if we may judge of a great&mdash;or a little&mdash;unknown after the
appearance and the bearing of those who select him as a social sponsor
for themselves and their literary catechumens) I can most sincerely
assert that I desire to have none.</p>
<p><a name="footnote261"></a><a href="#citation261">{261}</a>&nbsp;
Surely, for <i>sweet&rsquo;st</i> we should read <i>swift&rsquo;st</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote262a"></a><a href="#citation262a">{262a}</a>&nbsp;
This word occurs but once in Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And speaking it, he wistly looked on me;</p>
<p>(<i>King Richard II</i>. Act v. Sc. 4.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and in such a case, as in the previous instances of the words <i>invocate</i>
and <i>endamagement</i>, a mere &alpha;&pi;&alpha;&xi; &lambda;&epsilon;y&omicron;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&nu;
can carry no weight of evidence with it worth any student&rsquo;s consideration.</p>
<p><a name="footnote262b"></a><a href="#citation262b">{262b}</a>&nbsp;
This form is used four times by Shakespeare as the equivalent of Bretagne;
once only, in one of his latest plays, as a synonym for Britain.</p>
<p><a name="footnote263a"></a><a href="#citation263a">{263a}</a>&nbsp;
Another word indiscoverable in any genuine verse of Shakespeare&rsquo;s,
though not (I believe) unused on occasion by some among the poets contemporary
with his earlier years.</p>
<p><a name="footnote263b"></a><a href="#citation263b">{263b}</a>&nbsp;
This word was perhaps unnecessarily altered by our good Capell to &ldquo;tender.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote264a"></a><a href="#citation264a">{264a}</a>&nbsp;
Yet another and a singular misuse of a word never so used or misused
by Shakespeare.</p>
<p><a name="footnote264b"></a><a href="#citation264b">{264b}</a>&nbsp;
Qu.&nbsp; Why, so is your desire: If that the law, etc.?</p>
<p><a name="footnote264c"></a><a href="#citation264c">{264c}</a>&nbsp;
<i>Sic</i>.&nbsp; I should once have thought it impossible that any
mortal ear could endure the shock of this unspeakable and incomparable
verse, and find in the passage which contains it an echo or a trace
of the &ldquo;music, wit, and oracle&rdquo; of Shakespeare.&nbsp; But
in those days I had yet to learn what manner of ears are pricked up
to listen &ldquo;when rank Thersites opes his mastiff jaws&rdquo; in
criticism of Homer or of Shakespeare.&nbsp; In a corner of the preface
to an edition of &ldquo;Shakspere&rdquo; which bears on its title-page
the name (correctly spelt) of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s youngest son prefixed
to the name I have just transcribed, a small pellet of dry dirt was
flung upwards at me from behind by the &ldquo;able editor&rdquo; thus
irritably impatient to figure in public as the volunteer valet or literary
lackey of Prince Leopold.&nbsp; Hence I gathered the edifying assurance
that this aspirant to the honours of literature in livery had been reminded
of my humbler attempts in literature without a livery by the congenial
music of certain four-footed fellow-critics and fellow-lodgers of his
own in the neighbourhood of Hampstead Heath.&nbsp; Especially and most
naturally had their native woodnotes wild recalled to the listening
biped (whom partial nature had so far distinguished from the herd) the
deep astonishment and the due disgust with which he had discovered the
unintelligible fact that to men so ignorant of music or the laws of
music in verse as my presumptuous and pitiable self the test of metrical
harmony lay not in an appeal to the fingers but only in an appeal to
the ear&mdash;&ldquo;the ear which he&rdquo; (that is, which the present
writer) &ldquo;makes so much of&mdash;AND WHICH SHOULD BE LONG TO MEASURE
SHAKSPERE.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here then the great Sham Shakespearean secret
is out at last.&nbsp; Had I but known in time my lifelong error in thinking
that a capacity to estimate the refinements of word-music was not to
be gauged by length of ear, by hairiness of ear, or by thickness of
ear, but by delicacy of ear alone, I should as soon have thought of
measuring my own poor human organs against those of the patriarch or
leader of the herd as of questioning his indisputable right to lay down
the law to all who agree with his great fundamental theorem&mdash;that
the longest ear is the most competent to judge of metre.&nbsp; <i>Habemus
confitentem asinum</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote266"></a><a href="#citation266">{266}</a>&nbsp;
A Latin pun, or rather a punning Latinism, not altogether out of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
earliest line.&nbsp; But see the note preceding this one.</p>
<p><a name="footnote269"></a><a href="#citation269">{269}</a>&nbsp;
The simple substitution of the word &ldquo;is&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;
would rectify the grammar here&mdash;were that worth while.</p>
<p><a name="footnote270"></a><a href="#citation270">{270}</a>&nbsp;

I choose for a parallel Shakespeare&rsquo;s use of Plutarch in the composition
of his Roman plays rather than his use of Hall and Holinshed in the
composition of his English histories, because Froissart is a model more
properly to be set against Plutarch than against Holinshed or Hall.</p>
<p><a name="footnote278"></a><a href="#citation278">{278}</a>&nbsp;
This brilliant idea has since been borrowed from the Chairman&mdash;and
that without acknowledgment&mdash;by one of those worthies whose mission
it is to make manifest that no burlesque invention of mere man&rsquo;s
device can improve upon the inexhaustible capacities of Nature as shown
in the production and perfection of the type irreverently described
by Dryden as &lsquo;God Almighty&rsquo;s fool.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote279"></a><a href="#citation279">{279}</a>&nbsp;
This word was incomprehensibly misprinted in the first issue of the
Society&rsquo;s Report, where it appeared as &ldquo;foulness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
To prevent misapprehension, the whole staff of printers was at once
discharged.</p>
<p><a name="footnote291"></a><a href="#citation291">{291}</a>&nbsp;
When the learned member made use of this remarkable phrase he probably
had in his mind the suggestive query of Agn&egrave;s, <i>si les enfants
qu&rsquo;on fait se faisaient pas l&rsquo;oreille</i>?&nbsp; But the
flower of rhetoric here gathered was beyond the reach of Arnolphe&rsquo;s
innocent ward.&nbsp; The procreation in such a case is even more difficult
for fancy to realise than the conception.</p>

all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
